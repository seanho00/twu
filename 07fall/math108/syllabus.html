<tr><th><h2>Description</h2></th><td>
This course is an introduction to applied statistics addressed, in particular, to students specializing in the field of nursing. The focus is on developing the conceptual aspects of the subject rather than the mathematical foundations and assumes no prerequisite except elementary algebra. Topics include descriptive statistics, probability, the normal, t-, chi-square and F-distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, correlation and regression, ANOVA. Applications are directed towards health and biological studies.

<li> Note that only a few questions from each homework will actually be marked.
Study groups are encouraged, but the final draft that you hand in must be
your own work.  All work must be shown for full marks.

<li> A scientific calculator is required; graphing or special statistical 
functions are not required.  Please have a separate calculator from your 
cell phone or PDA, since these are not allowed during exams.  Sharing of
calculators during exams is not permitted.

<li> During in-class quizzes/exams, all of the following are not permitted
