<p>
All lab assignments are taken from the textbook,
"Microsoft Office Access 2003" (ISBN 1-4188-4299-0).

<p>
All assignments are to be turned in electronically.  From your 
CMPT122 eCourses website, go to the "Workspace" and select the "Turn-in"
folder for the appropriate Lab.  Select "Add document" (the document type
doesn't matter; it's just for the icon).  Browse for the file you'd like
to upload.  Double-check that the (4) Location is the correct folder, and that
(5) Permission is <b>not</b> checked (otherwise your fellow classmates can see
what you've uploaded).

<p>
Please make sure that every file you upload to eCourses has your name
somewhere in the filename.  Preferred filename format is
<tt>CMPT122T Your Name Lab #.doc</tt> or something similar.

<p>
Where a question in the book asks you to write down your answers on a 
separate piece of paper, please type your answers in a Word document or
plain text file.  Be sure to indicate which question each answer corresponds
to.

<p>
If for some reason uploading to eCourses doesn't work, just attach your
files in an email to me.

<p>
Labs are due by the start of class on the due date.  The turn-in folder will
be closed at that time.  Labs can still be turned in late with a penalty of
5% per day.  There will be a separate folder for late turn-ins.  Labs turned
in after the start of class but before midnight the following day (this is
a period a little over 24 hrs) are docked 5%.  Labs turned in between midnight
the following day and midnight the day after are docked 10%; etc.
