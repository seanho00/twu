<div><a href="#" onClick="toggleAnswers()">[ click for answers ]</a></div>

<h3>Total: 20 marks. Due: Fri 24Sep 09:00am, uploaded to myCourses</h3>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
Please download from the course website (under "assignments") and use the
<a href="HW1-ADD.sav"><tt>HW1-ADD.sav</tt></a> dataset for this assignment.
This dataset is from 9th grade students who show behavioural tendencies that
can be described more-or-less like Attention Deficit Disorder symptoms.

<ol>

<li> <h3>Variable Labels and Levels (5 marks)</h3>
The dataset has been sloppily formed and doesn't even have proper labels or
levels of measurement for each of the variables.  Modify the SPSS file to
show proper labels for each variable as given below, and also set the proper
level of measurement: Scale (interval or ratio), ordinal, or nominal.
For the nominal variables, set the "Value" labels as indicated below.
<table border="1">
  <tr><th>Col#</th><th>Variable</th><th>Values</th><th><i>Level</i></th></tr>
  <tr><td>2</td><td>ADDSC score</td><td>higher = more "problems"</td><td><i>Scale/Interval</i></td></tr>
  <tr><td>3</td><td>Gender</td><td>1 = Male, 2 = Female</td><td><i>Categorical/Nominal/Dichotomous</i></td></tr>
  <tr><td>4</td><td>Repeat a grade</td><td>0 = No, 1 = Yes</td><td><i>Categorical/Nominal/Dichotomous</i></td></tr>
  <tr><td>5</td><td>IQ: "Intelligence" score</td><td>higher = more ability</td><td><i>Scale/Interval</i></td></tr>
  <tr><td>6</td><td>English course level in 9th grade</td><td>
      1 = College/Univ prep, 2 = General, 3 = Remedial</td><td><i>Ordinal</i></td></tr>
  <tr><td>7</td><td>English course grade</td><td>4 = A, 3 = B, etc.</td><td><i>Ordinal</i></td></tr>
  <tr><td>8</td><td>Grade point average in 9th grade</td><td></td><td><i>Scale/Interval</i></td></tr>
  <tr><td>9</td><td>Social problems at home</td><td>0 = No, 1 = Yes</td><td><i>Categorical/Nominal/Dichotomous</i></td></tr>
  <tr><td>10</td><td>Dropout</td><td>0 = No, 1 = Yes</td><td><i>Categorical/Nominal/Dichotomous</i></td></tr>

<li> <h3>IQ and English Grade (5 marks)</h3>
One question this research addresses is whether intelligence scores are
strongly associated with "English course grade" for the population of 9th grade
students from which this sample was drawn. What kind of correlation coefficient
provides the correct strategy for answering that question?  Calculate the
proper result using SPSS and indicate whether the result can be accurately
described as "large" using the convention described in the textbook.
<i><br>
  [2pts]: non-parametric correlation coefficient, either Spearman's rho or
  Kendall's tau.  If they choose Kendall's tau and don't cite the textbook or
  give some justification for it over Spearman, ask them why they chose it.<br>
  [1pt]: effect size using Spearman: large.  Using Kendall's tau: medium.
<br></i>
How would your analysis strategy have changed if you were correlating "English
course level in 9th grade" with IQ?
<i><br>
  [1pt]: no change; same non-parametric strategy applies.<br>
  [1pt]: effect size with English course level, using Spearman: medium.
  Using Kendall's tau: small.<br>
  <br>Extra positive comments for indications that student read SPSS help files
  and/or textbook for further details on Spearman's rho or Kendall's tau: e.g.,
  addressing tied ranks, etc.
<br></i>

<li> <h3>Social Problems and Dropping Out (5 marks)</h3>
If we want to explore whether social problems at home are associated with the
likelihood of dropping out of school, how do we approach that question? What do
the results from this sample suggest?
<i><br>
  [2pts]: chi-square analysis, explaining because of nominal levels.
  Also acceptable: Kendall's tau-b because of ordinal levels.
  Must explain rationale.<br>
  [3pts]: correct run of analysis and interpretation of p-value in output,
  suggesting there is a relationship.<br>
  <br>Extra positive comments if student considered continuity correction due
  to small cell sizes in "expected" values.
<br></i>

<li> <h3>Gender and ADD (5 marks)</h3>
Does the data in this sample support the stereotype that boys with ADD symptoms
tend to be "worse" (showing more problems) than girls showing the same kinds of
tendencies? Since we have a friend who believes that stereotype, we need to be
convincing and careful.  So, in addition to checking the stereotype
statistically, print out the boxplots for girls and for boys to help show what
is going on.  <em>(Hint: we need the boxplots to be presented side-by-side to be
  more convincing!</em>
<i><br>
  [3pts]: independent samples t-test: run analysis and correctly interpret output,
  using 1-tailed test due to directional hypothesis.
  Point-biserial correlation is an acceptable alternative.<br>
  [2pts]: side-by-side boxplots correctly output: e.g.,<br>
  Graph &rarr; Legacy Dialogs &rarr; Boxplots: <br>
  Use "Summaries for groups of cases", select Gender as "Category Axis", 
  select ADD Score as "Variable".<br>
  <br>Extra positive comments if student showed extra details for boxplot
  specifics, for addressing both the point biserial correlation & the t-test,
  or other examples of thoroughness.
<br></i>

<h2 class="break">Formatting</h2>
Format your answers to questions #2-4 in a single document (Word .doc or
similar), clearly formatted and written in complete sentences.  For this first
assignment, strict APA style is not necessary (but it will be for subsequent
assignments, so you should get some practise!).  Include any relevant plots as
figures within your document (again, APA style not necessary for this assignment).
Also create a <b>clean</b> SPSS output file (.spv) showing the relevant analyses and
plots.  Make sure your SPSS output file doesn't have any output from any other
"trial runs" you did!  It is possible to edit an output file to delete extraneous
output.
<i><br>
  Extra positive comments for clean and easily-readable write-up or SPSS output file,
  formatting that shows care, etc.
<br></i>

<h2>Turn-in</h2>
You should upload to myCourses the following:<ul>
  <li> Your write-up as a Word .doc (or similar)
  <li> Your edited HW1-ADD.sav dataset (with proper variable labels, etc.)
  <li> Your clean SPSS output file (.spv)
</ul>
