    CPSY 501 Fall 2010</a> HW2 Answer Key / Marking Rubric</h1>

<h2>Total: 20pts</h2>

<h2>APA style (2pts)</h2><ul>
  <li> Format of reporting statistical results (most important!)
  <li> Use appropriate statistical symbols, no typos
  <li> Pagination and running heads, clear organization
  <li> Figures/tables not required, but if present must be in APA style
  <li> Detailed output goes in separate SPSS output file
</ul>

<h2>Question #1 (2pts): Outliers</h2><ul>
  <li> Use, e.g., boxplots
  <li> Quest: rows <b>47, 69</b>
  <li> Moratorium Identity Status (relationship): cases <b>26, 47</b>
  <li> Moratorium Identity Status (beliefs): none
  <li> Personal Meaning Profile (total): cases <b>9, 19, 55, 57</b>
  <li> Spiritual Well-being: cases <b>2, 6, 9, 19</b>
</ul>

<h2>Question #2 (3pts): Parametricity</h2><ul>
  <li> Scale level: examine meaning of outcome variables
  <li> Independence: check meaning of variables, study design
  <li> Normal distribution: use Kolmogorov-Smirnov or Shapiro-Wilk
  <li> Homogeneity of variance: only makes sense in relation to
  some predictor(s)!  With a scale-level predictor, use scatterplot;
  with categorical predictor, use Levene's test to check.
</ul>

<h2>Question #3 (1pt): Total Effect</h2><ul>
  <li> <em>R<sup>2</sup></em> = 54.5%; 
  or adjusted-<em>R<sup>2</sup></em> = 53.4%.
  <li> Additional discussion about inferential point estimates 
  vs. confidence intervals is not required but to be commended.
</ul>

<h2>Question #4 (2pts): Direction of Effect</h2><ul>
  <li> Negative relationship: use correlation coefficient
  or beta regression coefficient.
</ul>

<h2>Question #5 (1pt): Unique Effect of Developmental Vars</h2><ul>
  <li> <em>&Delta;R<sup>2</sup></em> = 5.2%
  <li> Include both Moratorium variables in last block
</ul>

<h2>Question #6 (3pts): Moratorium Relationship</h2><ul>
  <li> We can assess Marcia's model by testing whether either of
  the two Moratorium measures has a significant impact on SWB.
  <li> Assess whether there is a significant relationship using
  either correlation or regression coefficient (beta).  Make sure
  to check whether or not the relationship is significant.
  <li> The two Moratorium measures are Moratorium Identity Status
  (MIS) Belief and MIS-Relationship.
  <li> MIS-Belief shows a significant, negative relationship with SWB,
  hence it fits Marcia's model.
  <li> MIS-Relationship does not show a significant relationship with SWB,
  hence it does not fit Marcia's model.
</ul>

<h2>Question #7 (3pts): Unique Effect of Quest</h2><ul>
  <li> Zero-order effect of Quest on SWB: <em>r<sup>2</sup></em>=5.4%
  <li> Unique effect of Quest on SWB (place in last block of regression):
  <em>&Delta;R<sup>2</sup></em>=1.5%
  <li> Unique effect of MIS on SWB (place both MIS variables in last
  block of regression): <em>&Delta;R<sup>2</sup></em>=5.2%
  <li> Hence Quest has a smaller unique effect than Moratorium.
</ul>

<h2>Question #8 (3pts): Overly-Influential Cases</h2><ul>
  <li> Leverage: remove if &gt;0.5, or if &gt;0.2 and Cook's distance
  &gt;1.  No overly-influential cases.
  <li> Largest leverage is 0.11782 (case #28).
  <li> Largest Cook's distance is 0.089.
  <li> May also use Field's method on p.217:
  k = (# predictors) = 4, so
  average leveraged value = (k+1)/N = 5/160 = 0.031, so
  cutoff = 3(0.031) = 0.094.
  <li> Using Field's method, 3 candidate overly-influential cases,
  with leverages 0.11782, 0.10082, 0.09509.
</ul>
