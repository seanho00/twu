    CPSY 501 Fall 2010</a> HW3 Answer Key / Marking Rubric</h1>

<h2>Total: 20pts</h2>

<h2>APA style (2pts)</h2><ul>
  <li> Format of reporting statistical results (most important!)
  <li> Use appropriate statistical symbols, no typos
  <li> Pagination and running heads, clear organization
  <li> Figures/tables not required, but if present must be in APA style
  <li> Detailed output goes in separate SPSS output file
</ul>

<h2>(1) Outliers (2pts)</h2><ul>
  <li> Run boxplots, note no potential outliers.
  <li> Note that missing data is a problem.
  If we use <tt>Graphs &rarr; Boxplots &rarr; List-wise</tt> deletion,
  then there are 7 missing data cases.
  <li> If the other option is selected, there are more missing cases for
  follow-up than for other cases, due to attrition.
  <li> FYI: In helping sessions, explain about mean imputation and the need for
  dealing with missing data, but encourage them to allow listwise deletion for
  the exercise.
</ul>

<h2>(2) Sphericity and Equality of Covariance (2pts)</h2><ul>
  <li> Run <tt>Analyze &rarr; GLM &rarr; Univariate &rarr; Repeated-Measures</tt>
  <li> Sphericity is not satisfied; use Huynh-Feldt epsilon (&epsilon;)
  for correction.  Report <em>W</em> and &Chi;<sup>2</sup>.
  <li> Equality of variances is okay; report Levene's test <em>F</em> and
  <em>p</em>-value for all three DVs.
  <li> Covariance matrices are not equal; report Box's test <em>M</em> and
  <em>F</em>.
  <li> FYI: we can still proceed with analysis even though equality of
  covariance matrices is violated, because the sample size is fairly big,
  so the <em>p</em>-values are likely to be conservative.  Checking this
  would involve randomly deleting cases until cell sizes are equal, which
  is more involved than the scope of this assignment.
</ul>

<h2>(3) Time Effect and Interaction (6pts)</h2><ul>
  <li> Run <tt>Analyze &rarr; GLM &rarr; Univariate &rarr; Repeated-Measures</tt>.
  DV is WEL; IVs are Video Type and Time.
  <li> Can also combine this ANOVA run with the next question and include
  Gender as another IV.
  <li> Need to use the Huynh-Feldt epsilon (&epsilon;) for correction.
  <li> Main effect for Time is significant, however
  <li> Interaction between Time and Video Type is significant, so the Time 
  main effect is not interpretable by itself.
  <li> Interpretation of the interaction: the workshop leads to an increase in
  WEL for both groups, but only those viewing the modelling video show
  maintained (or increased) WEL at the follow-up period.
  Use an interaction plot and/or the cell means to demonstrate this pattern.
  <li> EXTRA: If anyone wanted to test for simple effects, they would
  have to focus on the group difference at the follow-up period. If it is done
  correctly, acknowledge and commend.  But post hoc tests for
  Time are not appropriate, given that the main effect is misleading.
</ul>

<h2>(4) Gender as a Moderator (8pts)</h2><ul>
  <li> Run <tt>Analyze &rarr; GLM &rarr; Univariate &rarr; Repeated-Measures</tt>.
  DV is WEL; IVs are Video Type, Gender, and Time.
  <li> Need to use the Huynh-Feldt epsilon (&epsilon;) for correction.
  <li> The highest significant interaction is the 3-way interaction.
  It shows how the treatment effect looks different for each gender
  (i.e., is moderated by gender).
  <b>(2pts for SPSS, labelling output, identifying 3-way interaction)</b>

  <li> Graph the <b>3-way</b> interaction and interpret its meaning.
  <b>(2pts: graphs, stats, clear interpretation)</b><ul>
    <li> The treatment effect for the nature video is the same for men and
    women: higher WEL scores show at the end of the workshop and then drop off
    at follow-up.
    <li> The treatment effect for the modelling video, on the other hand, is 
    different for males and females. Women show a "delayed" effect of the 
    modelling video: self efficacy (WEL) continues to rise after the workshop.
    That pattern is not shown among the men.
  </ul>

  <li> Consider the significant <b>2-way</b> interactions (graphs/stats),
  or note that the significant 3-way interaction supersedes the 2-way
  interactions, so they don't need to be interpreted independently.
  <b>(2pts)</b>

  <li> <b>Treatment effect</b>: The Time x Video Type interaction is the 
  treatment effect. The 3 way interaction shows that the treatment effect 
  pattern is true for women ("most similar"), while for men, the pattern is 
  just that the WEL decline at follow-up is somewhat less for men who viewed 
  the modelling video, compared to the men who viewed the nature video 
  (i.e., the pattern for men seems more different from the overall pattern 
  than is true for women). <b>(2pts)</b>

  <li> EXTRA: If anyone wanted to test for simple effects, they would have to
  focus on the group difference at the follow-up period. This is especially
  difficult to do with the more complex analysis, but support discussion of
  these points.
</ul>
