<tr><th><h2>Description</h2></th><td>
Statistical tools and knowledge necessary for success in business endeavours.
Descriptive statistics, probability (with discrete and continuous
distributions), hypothesis testing, regression, and ANOVA. Students learn
theory behind the methods, and primarily use spreadsheets as tools for solving
advanced problems.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Objective</h2></th><td>
    After completing this course, you should be comfortable handling and
    collecting data sets of many different varieties. You should be able to
    take a data set, provide summary statistics and analyse key patterns in the
    data. You should be able to formulate and answer questions about data sets
    using more advanced techniques too. After having used these tools yourself,
    you should also be able to interpret and analyse the findings of others (in
    the form of business reports, journal articles, newspaper articles, etc.).
    Finally, you should gain experience presenting data in an intelligible way,
    explaining relationships and findings to others in the business world.

<tr><th><h2>Notes</h2></th><td>
<ol>

<li> <b>Homeworks</b> are due as indicated on <a href="schedule.html">the 
class schedule page</a> (in case of conflict with the myCourses deadline,
the schedule page takes priority).
<b>NO LATE HOMEWORKS</b> except for extenuating circumstances.
All homeworks are to be turned in electronically on myCourses.
Acceptable formats include Excel (xls, xlsx), Word (doc, docx), PDF, and
LibreOffice formats (ods, odt); when in doubt, ask me before the due date.

<li> 
Study groups are encouraged, but the final homework that you submit must be
<b>your own work</b> (your own thinking, writing, Excel work, etc.).
(The one exception to this is the term project, which will generally be
done in groups -- <a href="project.html">read for more details</a>.)
If you do study in a group, please indicate in your assignment the names of
your group members; it saves me time in marking.
Copying others' work not only is a serious violation of TWU's policy on
academic integrity, it also cheats yourself out of the education you are
pursuing.

<li> <b>Attendance</b> to every lecture is <i>not</i> mandatory.  If you come to
class, come because you want to learn and ask questions.  If you'd rather spend
your time on Facebook, it's more comfortable to stay in your room!
In my experience it is 100% impossible to excel in this
course -- and very unlikely even to pass the course -- without attending 
lecture regularly, unless you have learned this material before.
Also, see the next note below.
Attendance is mandatory for the in-class exams.

<li> 5% of your final grade is for <b>professionalism</b>, which encompasses
participation in class, punctuality, attitude toward classmates and the
instructor, clarity and formality in submitted work, dress (aim for "business
casual"), etc.  This course is a professional work environment; treat it as
such.

<li> <b>Computers</b> in the lab in CanIL 115 are for <i>course-related
work</i> only!  I'm trusting you to observe this on the honour rule. Be aware 
that what you do on the computer is visible and can be distracting to those
behind and around you.  Appropriate use of campus computing facilities (this
includes use of campus WiFi from your own laptop) is not only a part of the
honour code and TWU Community Covenant, but more importantly a part of personal
integrity and professionalism.

<li> <b>Academic integrity</b> is a core value of the entire TWU community.
This includes, but is not limited to, avoiding all forms of plagiarism and 
cheating.  Plagiarism is using someone else's work without attribution.
In this course, if you do it once you will get a zero on the assignment; if
you do it again you will automatically fail the course.  Any such cases also
go into the University's files for future reference; TWU has a strict policy
concerning plagiarism.

A tutorial describing plagiarism and how to avoid it has been
prepared by TWU Librarian William Badke:
<a href="http://acts.twu.ca/library/plagiarism.ppt">(PPT file)</a>,
<a href="http://acts.twu.ca/library/Plagiarism.swf">(14 min flash)</a>,
<a href="http://acts.twu.ca/library/Plagiarism_Short.swf">(8 min flash)</a>

<li>In case of inclement weather, the TWU campus conditions will be announced
on local radio stations and posted on the TWU website at
<a href="http://www.twu.ca/conditions/">www.twu.ca/conditions</a>.
