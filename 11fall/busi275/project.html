    BUSI 275 Fall 2011</a> Term Project</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The objective of this course is not only that you understand the theory (math)
behind statistical analyses, but also that you demonstrate how to apply them
appropriately to practical situations in business.  As such, the term project
is a vital component of the course and should represent the pinnacle of your
work in this course (more so even than the final exam).  

<br>
For the term project, you will <ul>
  <li> Choose a data-driven, business-related topic you are interested in
  from the list below;
  <li> Investigate and do background research on the issue;
  <li> Gather data (or find suitable pre-existing datasets);
  <li> Perform appropriate in-depth statistical analyses on the data
  (e.g., in Excel);
  <li> Present your results in a 15-min in-class presentation; and
  <li> Present your results in a well-written, clearly organized paper.
</ul>

In the business world you will often (nearly always) need to work in teams,
and so in this project you will be expected to work in teams of 2-4 students.
Everyone in your group will get the same mark for the project, and once the
project proposal is submitted, the team cannot be disbanded -- so choose your
teammates wisely!
Learning how to work in a team is one of the main objectives of this project;
it is not easy, but it is important and worth the effort.  Giving up on
working together is giving up on one of the primary objectives; it <em>is</em>
your responsibility to make it work!  If you are having difficulty with your
teammates, I can offer suggestions on conflict resolution, but I will not be
your mediator; you must learn to be peacemakers.

<blockquote>
  "Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in
  love. Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of
  peace."
  <a href="http://mobile.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+4&version=NIV">
    (Ephesians 4:2-3, NIV)</a>
</blockquote>

<h2>Topics</h2>
Choose one of the following options, or come up with your own idea of similar
scope and depth:<ul>
  <li> <b>Distribution fit</b>:<br>
  Select a random event for which you can get empirical data.  Gather data
  about the event, and describe the underlying statistical distribution.
  Discuss the possible factors that cause variation.  Explain how this
  information could be used for a decision-making in a business environment.
  Detail all the options you tried and what guided your decisions.
  You must demonstrate a detailed, in-depth attempt to understand the
  underlying distribution; the final fit ought to be very close.

  <li> <b>Financial Analysis / Time Series</b>:<br>
  Select an "interesting variable" of some kind which can be easily found and
  calculated from publicly available financial data.  Develop a statistical
  model which could be used as a standard to measure performance for future
  numbers.  The "interesting variable" you select should be something with a
  business impact.  Examples could include:<ul>
    <li> "Performance of environmentally friendly mutual funds",
    <li> "Acquisition price for soccer players",
    <li> "Future price of oil on the NYMEX",
    <li> "Same-store sales growth in retail".
  </ul>

  <li> <b>Multiple Regression</b> (possibly with non-linear variables):<br>
  Conduct a multiple regression study, and report on the results.
  Be sure to examine and discuss possible interaction effects.

  <li> <b>ANOVA</b>:<br>
  Consider the case studies 12.1-12.4 on pp.526-528 in the textbook.
  Identify an ANOVA study you can conduct similar to one of these studies.
  Gather data, perform the analysis, and report on the results and the 
  business impact.  You may have single or multiple predictors.  Be sure
  to do follow-up analysis (post-hoc or planned comparisons).
</ul>

<a name="data"><h2>Dataset Description (due 4 Oct)</h2></a>
Find an existing dataset or describe in detail how you are going to collect
your own data.  Existing data can be from public sources (e.g., StatCan,
U.S. Census, etc.) or from private sources (in which case you need to make
sure you have permission to use it, as well as possible REB approval).
If you plan to gather your own data, you will need to detail your sampling
strategy (e.g., friends+family via word-of-mouth, stand on campus/street
corner, work with a local retailer, etc.) as well as your data collection
strategy (e.g., online questionnaire, oral interview).  If you plan on 
offering participants an incentive (e.g., chance to win a gift card), you
need to make that clear (because it does affect your sampling).

<ul>
<li>Indicate the "owners" of the dataset, and whether you have obtained
permission to use the data.
<li>Indicate the overall sample size
<li>For each variable in the dataset that you plan on using, describe it 
in detail, indicate its
level of measurement, and show how many missing cases there are.
<li>For any scale-level variables (interval or ratio), show means and
standard deviations, plus box-plots and histograms.
<li>For any nominal (categorical) or ordinal variables, show the frequency
distribution using appropriate charts (e.g, bar chart, pie chart).
</ul>

<h3>Deliverables:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Upload</b> a single document (Word, PDF, or similar) to 
  myCourses by 10pm on the due date.  It should be formatted clearly and
  cleanly (make sure to size figures/charts appropriately) in MLA style
  or similar.
</ul>


<a name="REB"><h2>REB Forms (due 11 Oct)</h2></a>
By law, any research involving human subjects must be done according to
standards of research ethics.  If you are gathering your own data (e.g.,
questionnaires) or using existing non-public data that involves human subjects,
you will need to submit a form to TWU's Research Ethics Board (REB) for
approval.  You are <b>not</b> permitted to begin recruiting subjects or
gathering data until you have received REB approval!  Allow 3 weeks for this to
happen.  If you are using public data (e.g., StatCan or US Census), then you
generally will not require REB approval -- however, for class purposes, you
will still need to complete a REB form.

For more on why research ethics is important and what the REB will be looking
for, <a href="http://www.pre.ethics.gc.ca/eng/education/tutorial-didacticiel/">
see the Tri-Council Course on Research Ethics (CORE)</a>.  If the REB rejects
your application with major revisions, you may be required to complete this
online tutorial.

See <a href="http://www.twu.ca/academics/research/ethics/approval-forms.html">
  TWU's REB page</a> for more details; the forms you need are at the bottom
of the page: either "Request for Ethical Review" (if you are gathering new
data) or "Analysis of Existing Data" (if you are using data that was originally
gathered for another REB-approved study).

On the form, list the instructor as your project's supervisor.  Your project's
principal investigator ("PI") should be one from your team; you may select
one student arbitrarily.

<h3>Deliverables:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> By classtime on the due date, submit to me a completed, signed,
  <b>printed</b> copy of the appropriate REB form, depending
  on whether you are gathering your own data or using existing data.
  If you are using public data that does not require REB approval, you do
  not need to submit a printed copy, however you for class purposes you still
  need to upload a completed electronic copy.
  <li> Also, <b>upload</b> an electronic copy of your completed REB form
  to myCourses.
</ul>

<a name="proposal"><h2>Project Proposal (due 25 Oct)</h2></a>
Write a short summary (one-half to one page) describing
the work your team proposes to do: <ul>
  <li> Describe your dataset and the dependent and independent variables.
  <li> If you will be gathering your own data, describe how you plan on 
  doing that.
  <li> Discuss the statistical question you will be posing to the data
  (which hypothesis test, what model) and your expected outcome.
  E.g., "We plan to run two-way factorial ANOVA analysing the effect of
  call centre and time of day on wait times.  We expect to find a significant
  main effect with time of day but no significant interaction."
  <li> Plan how you will divide the work amongst your team members.
</ul>

<h3>Deliverables:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Upload</b> your proposal to myCourses by 10pm on the due date.
</ul>

<a name="present"><h2>Presentation (in-class, 29 Nov and 1 Dec)</h2></a>
Deliver a 15-min, in-class presentation on your project.  If your analysis is
not yet complete by the time you do your presentation, that is okay, but you
should have some preliminary results to present.

<ul>
  <li> The format of your presentation is up to you, but you <em>must</em> keep
  it under 15 minutes.  The instructor may interrupt you to ask questions,
  which will not increase the time you have available.  You may solicit
  questions from the audience, but that will also not increase the time you
  have available.

  <li> You will be graded not only on the content of the presentation, but
  also your clarity, delivery style, professional demeanor, etc.  Treat this
  as if you are presenting to your company's CEO or board of directors.
  Do <b>not</b> assume that they are familiar with statistical methods.
  It is recommended that you dress "business casual"; the rule of thumb is to
  dress "one step above" your audience.

  <li> Every member of your team must participate in the presentation.

  <li> In addition to your own presentation, you must attend and fill out a
  short feedback form for other presentations by your classmates.
  The feedback forms will be provided to the presenters for their reference.
</ul>

<h3>Deliverables:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> By Tue 15 Nov, <b>sign up</b> for a time slot to do your presentation.
  There will be six slots available per day, on 29 Nov, and 1 Dec.
  <li> <b>Upload</b> your presentation slides (PPT, PDF, ODP, etc.) to myCourses
  at least 24hrs before your presentation.
  <li> <b>Deliver</b> your presentation in-class.
  <li> Fill out <b>feedback</b> forms for in-class presentations by
  other teams.  (Hand in the forms to me at the end of class.)
</ul>

<a name="paper"><h2>Paper (due Wed 7 Dec)</h2></a>
Your paper must be a complete, well-written exposition of the topic you have
chosen, the analysis you performed, and your results and conclusions.  You will
need to do background research and cite reliable sources.  As appropriate,
include select tables or figures in the body of the paper to illustrate the 
points made in your paper.  Further tables or charts can go in an appendix.

As with the presentation, your target audience is someone like your CEO or
board of directors -- they are giving you a chance to communicate your
results, but you need to convince them of the relevance and validity of
your work in a way that they can understand.  Do <b>not</b> assume they are
familiar with statistical methods.

There is no length limitation on the paper!  However, your paper must satisfy
all the requirements given, following the outline below.  Typically, BUSI275
papers that meet these requirements have averaged around 4000 words.  But there
is no minimum length; if you can write a clear, concise paper that meets all
the requirements in less than 4000 words, so much the better!

<ul>
  <li> <b>Abstract:</b> a short summary (half a page at most) describing
  the basic results of your research at a glance.  
  <li> <b>Introduction:</b> describe your topic and tell me why you think 
  it's relevant or interesting.
  <li> <b>Related Work:</b> research what other people have done related to
  your topic and summarize their findings.  For example, another researcher
  might have done the exact same analysis but on a different dataset.
  Try to keep the introduction and this section short, in favour of more 
  space for your own methods and results.
  <li> <b>Methods:</b> tell me about the variables and the dataset you have
  chosen, and describe how the data were gathered.
  Describe your analysis in a way that is understandable to someone who 
  might not know or care about the statistics, but also is sufficiently
  detailed that an interested party could reproduce your results.
  <li> <b>Results and conclusions:</b> what effects were significant?
  What effects weren't significant?  Do the results agree with what you
  expected?  Interpret the results and tell me what it all means in the 
  context of your original topic.
  <li> <b>Future work:</b> if you or another researcher were to continue
  in this topic, what would be the next step?  How could your dataset or
  analysis be improved?  (This section can be short.)
  <li> <b>References:</b> particularly for the "Related Work" section,
  you will need to do background research and cite sources.  The point of
  a list of references is to enable the reader to look up your sources.
  <li> <b>Appendix</b> (optional): For tables/figures in the body of the
  paper, you should be very selective so that they do not take up too much
  space or overwhelm or bore the reader.  For any additional tables/figures
  you wish to include, you may put them in an appendix.  You may also
  separately upload Excel spreadsheets or other datafiles.
  The appendix is optional.
</ul>

Your paper should be in proper, professional English.  Avoid colloquialisms.
As appropriate, prefer the active voice ("We performed linear regression on the
data") over the passive ("linear regression was performed on the data").
Actions have agents, so indicate who they are: if you were the one who
performed a step, then the use of the pronoun "We" (or "I") is appropriate ("We
performed...").  If you are citing someone else's analysis, then indicate who
did it: "McDermott et al. performed a similar analysis...".

I will not be strict on formatting, as long as your paper is clear and
readable.  A suggested format is the MLA style:
<a href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/">Purdue OWL</a>
has a helpful guide.

I highly recommend that you submit a rough draft early on to get feedback.
This paper constitutes a major portion of your final grade, and you don't
want to be surprised that you were heading down the wrong path!

<h3>Deliverables:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Upload your complete paper, as a single document,
  to myCourses by 10pm on the due date.
  <li> If you wish, you may upload any datafiles, spreadsheets, etc. as
  separate files, however the paper should be complete without these.
</ul>
