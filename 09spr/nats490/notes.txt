=== CJ : 14:40 - 14:58
(Chr.G, MattD)

book addl resources helpful
overview: "two ends of spectrum", +personal opinion
title slide setup good -- would have been nice to have actual slides

more smiles

thesis slide detailed and with proposed action, but a bit long!

outline slide would have been nice:
history -> cultural whaling -> IWC

Chr perspective: Jewish Kosher analysis interesting

"what can be done?" slide -- good to highlight this is your opinion

Q&A: passionate and connected well with audience;
some questions seemed to throw you off a little

=== KH : 15:20 - 15:35
(CJ, Joni)

excellent photos and descriptions, great intro and setup to the issue
would like more stats on slides: disease rates, asthma, malaria, etc.
  1/4 world pop in slums -- defn slum?

loved spending time on a long passage in Zech

bioremediation:
  * water: good pros/cons
  * soil: good ex Gasworks Park
gardening: would be nice to see stats on health benefits (pancreatic cancer)

background photos, verses, poem -- lots of beauty!  refreshing

Q&A: very respectful and affirming with audience; humble in acknowledging
when audience's comments contributed something you didn't know


=== John : 14:38 - 14:59
(Elise, Katherine)

great topic!  high level of Biblical integration

Loved first summary slide highlighting connections between
various entities: God, humans, technology
=> wonderful connection with concluding slide!  Red text highlighting
question => answer was very powerful!

=> Q&A was helpful: why look at US?  because tech that most impacts society
all comes from U.S.  And global economy is heavily influenced by U.S.

* Summary/conclusion slide very good
* two slides applying the Judges cycle to the U.S. are good
==> but how do they connect?  How do you arrive at the conclusions
based upon the U.S. Judges cycle?
