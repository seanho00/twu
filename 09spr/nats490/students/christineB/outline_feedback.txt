Hi Christine,

Great topic; this is a very important issue and one in which a Christian
worldview ought to have a lot to contribute!  I am drawn to your thesis
statement about the potentially misleading labels of "green products".
I would like to see more development of this thesis -- what are the
hidden costs or environmental factors that aren't currently measured,
and what would be a better metric to define the "green" label.
Remember also that this paper is about how a Christian worldview might
speak into a current hot topic in science.
I am expecting that the whole paper will weave throughout it a distinctly
Christian worldview -- Bible verses, quotes from theologians, etc. -- and
show how it uniquely illustrates/drives a solution to the problem.
Your outline looks promising in setting up the problem -- the vested interests
who might bias metrics of "green", the current metrics of "green", and why
those metrics are insufficient.  I'd like to see more of a proposed solution,
explicitly informed by a Christian worldview.

Very promising, and this is a fantastic topic!  I can imagine a lot of
lively discussion in the Q&A time!  I'm looking forward to reading your paper!

Sean
