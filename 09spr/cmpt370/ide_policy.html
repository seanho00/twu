		CMPT 370 Spring 2009</a>  Development Environment Policy</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
As this class is titled, "Advanced Programming", it is very
programming-intensive, and the programming labs are really the heart of the 
course.
I understand that you all may be coming from different programming backgrounds
and may have different integrated development environments (IDEs) that you
are familiar with, for instance,
Microsoft Visual Studio, Eclipse, CodeWarrior, etc.  The problem-solving
concepts and the programming skills are what's important, not the IDE, however
on the job, unfamiliarity with an IDE or unwillingness to learn a new IDE
can slow things down.

<p>
As far as marking labs is concerned, the general principle is that I need to be
able to read your code and run your program; I don't require that I can compile
it.  Win32 programs I can run on the senior lab PCs.  I also have a Linux
laptop (glibc-2.5) if you submit linux executables.  I don't have ready access
to a Mac.  Other arrangements can be made; we're a small class, so things are
flexible -- e.g., if you absolutely must work on OSX, we can make arrangements
for you to demo your lab project for me.

<h2>Policy for this course</h2>

<p>
For this course, there will be a mixture of lenience and rigid rules concerning
use of different IDEs.  For the FLTK and OpenGL parts of the course (most of the
semester), you may use a different IDE (but see the restrictions below).  For
the OpenMP part of the course, you are required to use gcc-4 on carmel.

<p>
<h3>
The officially supported development environment for this course is gcc/g++
under Cygwin on the senior lab PCs, using 'make' and plain text editors like
Notepad.
</h3>
No official support will be given of other development environments -- if you
can't get FLTK compiling on your own PC under MSVC, that's your own problem.
It's not as flashy as Visual Studio, but it
gets the job done, and it's good for you to learn multiple environments!
However, you are free to use a different (unsupported) environment if you wish,
including on your own computer at home, however you do need
to use FLTK-1.x and C++.

<p>The portion of the class on shared-memory parallel
processing will be done under gcc-4 on carmel, a quad-core, eight-hyperthreaded
linux machine.
If you have access to another machine with at least eight processors (HT is
okay) and OpenMP, ask me.  OpenMP is available on gcc only post-4.1.0, and on
MSVC++ only in VS 2005 (not VS .NET or earlier).

<p>
Again, we're a small class, so other arrangements can be made.  If you do
choose to use an IDE other than the officially supported environment (gcc,
cygwin, make on the senior lab PCs), please send me an email.

<h2>Programming Language</h2>

<p>
So far this policy just talked about the development environment (compiler,
editor, etc.).  What about the programming language?  For this I will lock down
a bit tighter: we will use C/C++.   FLTK does have other bindings, but C++ is
the standard one, and C++ is still pretty much the industry standard, for
better or worse.  Again, there is a little flexibility; if you are really
dead-set on using Python or Java, talk to me.  But I'm strongly steering
everyone towards C++ for purposes of this class.

<p>
If you need a refresher in C++, try:<ul>

tutorial</a>
</ul>

<h2>Installing Cygwin</h2>

Cygwin is already installed on the senior lab PCs; you are free to install it
on your own computers, but no official support will be provided.  Here are some
tips:<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Get Cygwin</a> and run
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/setup.exe">the setup.exe installer</a>.
<li> In the "Select Packages" part of the wizard, in the "Devel" category,
select at least the following packages:<ul>
  <li> gcc-core
  <li> gcc-g++
  <li> fltk
  <li> make
  </ul>
  In the "Graphics" category, select the following package:<ul>
  <li> opengl
  </ul>
  Feel free to select whatever other packages you like.
  You might, for instance, like a text editor like joe, nano, or nedit.
<li> You should now be able to compile and run FLTK programs within Cygwin.
Note that it is not necessary to download FLTK from fltk.org; the Cygwin
package installs FLTK in locations accessible to gcc from within Cygwin.
</ul>
