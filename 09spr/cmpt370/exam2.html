<li>
In your own words, compare the complementary fields of <b>computer graphics</b>
and <b>image analysis</b>. <u>[3]</u>
<br><i>
  Synthesis vs. analysis: both are components of visual computing.
  <b>Computer graphics</b> starts with digital representations of objects
  (triangle meshes, lights, etc.) and produces images on screen.
  <b>Image analysis</b> starts with images (digital camera, satellite, MRI,
  etc.) and produces digital representations of the objects in the images.

<li>
What is <b>colour</b>?  Is an RGB triple (e.g., "#00FF77") a colour?  Discuss.
<u>[4]</u>
<br><i>
  <b>Colour</b> is a distribution of light energy across the visible spectrum
  ("frequency distribution").  An <b>RGB triple</b> is a point in a colour
  space, a combination of three chromaticities.  Without specifying what those
  chromaticities are or how they are combined, an RGB triple is not a colour.

<li>
Contrast the goals of <b>off-line</b> rendering vs. <b>real-time</b> graphics.
Which is OpenGL generally used for? <u>[4]</u>
<br><i>
  <b>Off-line</b> rendering prioritizes photorealism and image quality over
  rendering time -- it's okay if each frame takes days to render, as long as
  it looks really good.  <b>Real-time</b> graphics places a constraint of
  rendering time -- we still want it to look good, but not if that means our
  framerate drops below, say, 60 frames per second.
  OpenGL is generally used for real-time rendering.

<li>
What does it mean for a set of vectors to be <b>linearly independent</b>?
<u>[3]</u>
<br><i>
  A set of vectors is linearly independent if no one vector in the set can be
  expressed as a linear combination of the other vectors.  If we were to remove
  any vector from the set, then the vector space spanned by the set would
  collapse by a dimension.
</i>
<br><br><br><br>

<li>
What are <b>homogeneous coordinates</b>, and how are they used in 3D computer
graphics?  <u>[3]</u>
<br><i>
  A consistent representation of both points and vectors.
  We add a fourth component, w, which is 0 for vectors and
  non-zero for points.  Every (x,y,z,w), with w != 0, represents
  the 3D point (x/w, y/w, z/w).
  We apply transforms in homogeneous coordinates via 4x4 matrices;
  e.g., the model-view matrix.
</i>
<br><br><br><br><br>

<li>
Describe the stages of the OpenGL rendering <b>pipeline</b>.  There is some
flexibility in how to divide the stages, but describe the operations that
must happen to get from geometry (GL primitives) to what we see on screen.
<u>[6]</u>
<br><i><dl>
    <dt>(1) Vertex processing:</dt> <dd>Transform vertex and normal via
    model-view matrix, per-vertex lighting calculation (for Gouraud),
    projection matrix</dd>
    <dt>(2) Assembly/clipping:</dt> <dd>Connect vertices into primitives,
    view frustum culling, clip against view volume</dd>
    <dt>(3) Rasterizer:</dt> <dd>Convert into pixel grid, interpolate
    per-vertex values across the primitive</dd>
    <dt>(4) Fragment processing:</dt> <dd>Per-fragment calculations,
    textures</dd>
    <dt>(5) Blending:</dt> <dd>Hidden-surface removal (depth buffer) and
    blending, final output to framebuffer</dd>

<li>
What are OpenGL <b>display lists</b>?  Why use them?
Describe an example situation well-suited to display lists. <u>[4]</u>
<br><i>
  OpenGL display lists store a sequence of OpenGL commands (e.g., material
  definitions, lights, primitives, matrix transforms) that are then stored in
  graphics hardware memory.  The display list can then be executed multiple
  times (perhaps with OpenGL state change in between) without resending the
  data to the hardware; this can potentially speed up the rendering.  For
  instance if a scene is to have many hundreds of teapots, it would make sense
  to store the teapot vertex data in a display list.
</i>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<li>
The two most important transform matrices in OpenGL are 
the <b>model-view</b> matrix and the <b>projection</b> matrix.
Contrast the roles of these two matrices. <u>[4]</u>
<br><i>
  The <b>model-view</b> matrix transforms from world coordinates to camera 
  coordinates: it specifies the location of objects in the virtual world 
  relative to the camera.  It is also what we use to position objects relative
  to each other.
  The <b>projection</b> matrix transforms from camera coordinates to screen 
  coordinates: it converts from 3D points to 2D points.
</i>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<li>
Contrast <b>orthographic</b> projection with <b>perspective</b> projection.
<u>[3]</u>
<br><i>
  The projector lines in orthographic projection are all parallel, whereas the
  projector lines in perspective projection converge to a single point, the
  center of projection.  Orthographic projection is equivalent to perspective
  projection with a center of projection infinitely far away.  Perspective
  results in foreshortening: closer objects appear larger, farther objects
  appear smaller.
</i>
<br><br><br><br>

<li>
Contrast <b>clipping</b> with <b>culling</b>.  Why are they important? <u>[4]</u>
<!-- fewer pts: 3pts -->
<br><i><dl>
    <dt>Clipping:</dt> <dd>Trims primitives to fit within the viewport and the
    current clip.  User-defined clip planes may be specified.  Clipping may
    reshape and introduce new vertices for primitives which intersect the
    clipping planes.
    </dd>
    <dt>Culling:</dt> <dd>Removes primitives which are not visible, even though
    they may be within the viewport.  For instance, back-face culling removes
    primitives that face away from the camera, which are generally not visible.
    </dd>

The GLUT function <tt>glutSolidTeapot(1.0)</tt> renders a
<a href="http://www.sjbaker.org/wiki/index.php?title=The_History_of_The_Teapot">Utah Teapot</a> with size 1, centred at the origin.
We want to render the teapot with size <tt>size</tt> (C++ float),
centred at the point (5, 6, 7),
and rotated counter-clockwise about its own z-axis by &theta;
(C++ float <tt>theta</tt>) degrees.
<ol class="subparts">
  <li>
  Without changing the call to <tt>glutSolidTeapot()</tt>,
  write a block of <b>C/C++ OpenGL code</b> to accomplish this. 
  (The parameter to <tt>glutSolidTeapot()</tt> is actually a size
  parameter, but I'm asking you not to use that for this question.)
  The exact naming/syntax of the functions is not as important as the 
  ordering.  <u>[3]</u>
  <br><i><pre>
  glTranslate3f( 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 );
  glRotatef( theta, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0 );
  glScalef( size, size, size );
  glutSolidTeapot(1.0);
  </pre></i>
  <br><br><br><br><br><br>

  <li>
  Write a single <b>4x4 matrix</b> that converts from the coordinate system 
  of the teapot (object coords) to the coordinate system of the world
  (world coords).  Assume left multiplication; i.e., a point p in
  homogeneous object coords will be multiplied by this matrix M to get
  the world coords <tt>p' = M p</tt>.
  (Hint: construct 4x4s for each of the transforms,
  and multiply the matrices in the correct order.  I will be lenient
  on minor mathematical errors as long as you show your work.)

What are <b>quaternions</b> and how are they used in computer graphics?
<u>[4]</u>
<br><i>
  Quaternions are a 4D Clifford algebra (extension of the complex numbers)
  having one real part and three imaginary parts: a typical quaternion
  might be, e.g., 3 + 6i - 5j + 0.2k.  Quaternion multiplication is
  associative but not commutative.  The unit quaternions are used to represent
  rotations in 3D; composition of rotations is simply multiplication of
  the corresponding quaternions.

<li>
Describe three representations of rotations in 3D that we talked about in class.
What are pros/cons of each?  <u>[4]</u>
<br><i><dl>
    <dt>Euler angles:</dt> <dd>Three angles indicating amount of rotation about the
    x, y, and z axes, respectively.  Order is important.  Problems with gimbal lock.
    </dd>
    <dt>Axis-angle:</dt> <dd>Three numbers indicating a unit vector about which to 
    rotate, and one number indicating angle of rotation about that axis.  This is 
    the format expected by <tt>glRotatef()</tt>.</dd>
    <dt>Unit quaternion:</dt> <dd>Four numbers (as described in previous problem).
    Easy to derive from axis-angle representation.  Easy to compose multiple 
    rotations via quaternion multiplication.</dd>

<li>
Name and describe the four terms in the OpenGL local <b>illumination model</b>.
For each term, list what <b>vectors</b>, if any, are required to compute the
term. <u>[5]</u>
<br><i><dl>
    <dt>Ambient:</dt> <dd>Uniform light that shines everywhere.
    No vectors needed.  </dd>
    <dt>Diffuse:</dt> <dd>Light that shines on a dull, non-shiny object.
    Need normal vector and vector to the light source.</dd>
    <dt>Specular:</dt> <dd>Highlights reflecting off a shiny object.
    Need view vector to camera and reflection vector.</dd>
    <dt>Emissive:</dt> <dd>Simulates a glowing object.  No vectors needed.</dd>
</dl></i>
<br><br><br><br>

<li>
How many numbers are needed to specify completely all the material properties
provided by OpenGL for an object?  Describe them. <u>[3]</u>
<br><i>
  17 numbers: RGBA for each of ambient, diffuse, specular, and emissive colours,
  plus the shininess coefficient.
</i>
<br><br><br><br><br>

<li>
Contrast <b>Gouraud</b> shading with <b>Phong</b> shading.  Which is better and
why?  Describe a situation where the difference might be very pronounced.
Which one is supported by the regular fixed-function OpenGL pipeline? <u>[4]</u>
<br><i><dl>
    <dt>Gouraud:</dt> <dd>Lighting calculations done <b>per-vertex</b>;
    shaded vertex colours are then interpolated (rasterized) across the face of
    the polygon.</dd>
    <dt>Phong:</dt> <dd>Lighting calculations done <b>per-fragment</b>
    (per-pixel): more work, but more accurate.</dd>
  </dl>
  The default OpenGL pipeline only does Gouraud.
  On a large polygon with high shininess, the small specular highlight may
  lie in the middle of the polygon, missing all the vertices.  In that case,
  Gouraud shading would miss the highlight altogether, whereas Phong shading
  would capture it.

<li>
Describe <b>bump mapping</b>: what is its purpose and how does it achieve it?
Describe an example situation where it might be useful.<u>[4]</u>
<br><i>
  Emulating bumpy surfaces without actually creating more geometry (more
  vertices).  Uses a bump map texture to indicate displacement of the surface
  (in or out).  Calculates how that displacement would perturb the normal
  vectors.  Per-fragment Phong shading then calculates the shaded colour of
  each fragment using the perturbed normals.  Example: orange.

Describe all the steps needed to create and apply a <b>texture map</b>
