Lab1 (30 pts): Your own FLTK program</h1>

<p> In this lab, you will design and implement a small FLTK program of 
your own choosing.

<ul>

<li> Your program should have a point to it: it should be "useful" in some way.
It doesn't have to be the next Microsoft Office, but there should be a 
clearly defined purpose to the program, and it <em>must</em> be easy to use.

<li> You must research and use an advanced FLTK widget / feature 
<em>beyond</em> what was covered in Lab0 (Fl_Box, Fl_Button, Fl_Input,
Fl_Menu*, etc.).

<li> Your code need not all be in Fluid: in fact, if your callbacks are
longer than one or two trivial lines, you should emphasize separation of logic
and layout: have a separate file (or two) for your callbacks.

<h2>Suggested project ideas</h2>

<li> Some suggestions to help you brainstorm: <ul>
  <li> A basic image viewer: provide a way for a user to select an image file,
  then display that image in a window.  Allow the user to specify the filename
  on the command line, too.  
  See <a href="http://www.fltk.org/doc-1.1/drawing.html#images">ch5 of
  the FLTK documentation</a>.
  (Hint: consider Fl_File_Chooser and Fl_JPEG_Image.)

  <li> A program to graph exponential functions f(t)=Ae<sup>rt</sup>:
  widgets to specify the initial population A and the growth rate r,
  and a large box in which to draw the graph using line segments or Bezier
  arcs.  Update the graph whenever any one of the input widgets changes value.
  See <a href="http://www.fltk.org/doc-1.1/drawing.html">ch5 of
  the FLTK documentation</a>.

  <li> A long-running program that makes use of the FL_Progress widget to
  provide feedback to the user.  Examples might include a program to find prime
  numbers or solve a Knight's Tour (CMPT145 problems).
  
  <li> A child's game to match pairs of cards ("Concentration"), similar
  to <a href="http://www.prongo.com/match/flowers.pl">this example</a>.
  (Hint: consider using buttons for the cards.)

</ul>

<li> Be creative; have fun!

<h2>Lab write-up</h2>

<li> Follow <a href="lab_template.html">the template lab write-up</a>
to document your program.  Name your write-up:
<br><tt>your_name_lab1_writeup.doc</tt> (or .txt, etc.)
<br>Put it in the same project directory as your code so that it will be
included in the tarball.

<h2>Electronic turn-in</h2>

<li> Put everything (C++ code, header files, Fluid files, executable, lab
write-up) into a ZIP or tarball and upload it to eCourses under "Lab1":
<br><tt>your_name_lab1.tar.gz</tt> or <tt>your_name_lab1.tar.gz</tt>

</ul>
