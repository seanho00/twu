<tr><th><h2>Description</h2></th><td>
This is a course in the elements of programming with one or more object
oriented programming languages.  Students will be introduced to the general
concepts of object oriented programming and will learn one object oriented
language in sufficient detail to be able to produce substantial programs.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Objective</h2></th><td>
The objective of the course is to make
students familiar with the main concepts of OOP.  The programming language C++,
which incorporates the principles of OOP,
will be used almost exclusively.  After taking this course
students should be able to write substantial programs in C++ and other OOP
languages.

This is installed on the senior lab PCs.
You may also use your own computer, as long as you have a compatible compiler.
(I will need to be able to recompile and run your programs.)

<ol>

<li> <b>All labs must be completed</b> -- if you do not turn in 
something for each lab, you will automatically fail the course.

<li> The good news is
the <b>late policy</b> is fairly lenient: penalty of 5% per calendar day, 
up to a week late.  More than a week late is
50% penalty.  More than two weeks late and it will not be accepted unless there
are extenuating circumstances.  We will use the timestamp on myCourses.  It is
your responsibility to make sure all parts of your lab are 
uploaded to the right place in myCourses by the deadline.

<li> If you turn in your lab on-time, you can expect
to have your lab marked within a week.  If you turn in your lab late,
you forfeit the privilege of getting prompt feedback.

<li> During in-class <b>quizzes/exams</b>, all of the following are not permitted 
and should be left in your closed/zipped bag and put on the floor:<ul>
  <li> Textbooks, notes, cell phones (turn off), laptops, PDAs, 
  <i>electronic dictionaries</i>, calculators.
</ul>
Scratch paper will be provided.
Your desk should be clear except for your pencil/pen.

<li>In case of <b>inclement weather</b>, call (604) 513-2147 or 
see <a href="http://www.twu.ca/conditions/">www.twu.ca/conditions</a>.
for official campus conditions.

<li>
As Christian scholars pursuing higher education,
we value <b>academic integrity</b> as a core 
value of the entire TWU community. Students are invited into this scholarly
culture and required to abide by the principles of sound academic scholarship
at TWU. This includes, but is not limited to, avoiding all forms of plagiarism
and cheating in scholarly work. TWU has a strict policy on plagiarism (see
academic calendar 2008-09, pp. 37-38). Learning what constitutes plagiarism and
avoiding it is the student's responsibility. An excellent resource describing
plagiarism and how to avoid it has been prepared by TWU Librarian William Badke
and is freely available for download
