<h1>Sorting Algorithms</h1>
<hr>

<p> We all know that Quicksort is one of the fastest algorithms for
sorting.  It's not often, however, that we get a chance to see exactly
<EM>how</EM> fast Quicksort really is.  The following applets chart
the progress of several common sorting algorithms while sorting an
array of data using <b>in-place</b> algorithms.  This means that the
algorithms do not allocate additional storage to hold temporary
results: they sort the data in place.  (This is inspired by the
algorithm animation work at <A href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/">Brown
University</a> and the video <em>Sorting out Sorting</em> By Ronald
Baecker from the University of Toronto (circa 1970!).)  </P>

<p> Some of these sorts are very stupid or very slow and should not be
used in code.  The use of Bubblesort is deprecated.  So don't use
Bubblesort!  Also, don't use Swapsort! It is only a demonstration of
the amount of time Java takes to swap n elements.  </p>

<p> In-Place Mergesort is yet another abomination.  Mergesort is
supposed to run in O(n log n), but the implementation here runs in O(n
* n).  This is because a temporary scratch array is not used.  As with
<b>most</b> of the examples here, In-Place Mergesort sorts the elements
in the array without using additional storage (other than the stack
used for the recursive calls, and temporary variables).  Jack Snoeyink
has provided me with a the Double Storage mergesort algorithm
sort implementation that uses a scratch array.</p>

One of my favorite references to sorting routines is "Sorting" by
William A. Martin, in ACM Computing Surveys, Volume 3, Number 4,
December 1971, pages 147-174.  The abstract reads:

<blockquote>
The bibliography appearing at the end of this article lists 37 sorting
algorithms and 100 books and papers on sorting published in the last
20 years.  The ideas presented here have been abstracted from this
body of work, and the best algorithms known are given as examples.  As
the algorithms are explained, references to related algorithms and
mathematical or experimental analyses are given. Suggestions are then
made for choosing the algorithm best suited to a given situation.
</blockquote>

<p>Disclaimer: If you use this page as part of your teaching, please
let me know.  I tend to refer students who ask too many questions back
to their instructor.  Requests for translations of the Java sources to
other programming languages will be denied.  This page was created in
a fit of "thesis avoidance" in the summer of 1996.</p>
