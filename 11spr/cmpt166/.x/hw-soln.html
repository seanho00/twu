Homeworks are due by the start of class (11:40) on the due date.</div>

<h2><a name="1">HW1 (due Tue 18 Jan) (10pts)</a></h2><ol>
  <li> Compare and contrast the <b>JDK</b> and the <b>JRE</b>.
  <i><br>Java Development Kit: JRE plus compiler (javac) for writing your own Java programs.
    <br>Java Runtime Environment: only the Java VM (java) for running precompiled Java programs.</i>

  <li> Compare and contrast <b>compiled</b> vs. <b>interpreted</b> languages.
  <i><br>Compiled: source code is compiled, linked, and assembled before being executed (run).
    Examples include C/C++, Java, M2, etc.
    <br>Interpreted: source code is compiled on-the-fly, allows for interactive sessions like
    in IDLE.  Examples include Python, Perl, JavaScript, etc.</i>

  <li> What do <b>comments</b> look like in Java?
  <i><br>Either C-style: /* comment */, or C++-style: // comment</i>

  <li> Write a minimal "Hello, World!" <b>program</b> in Java.
  <i><pre>
  	public class HelloWorld {
		public static void main( String args[] ) {
			System.out.println("Hello, World!");
		}
	}
</pre></i>

  <li> Describe the eight <b>primitive types</b> in Java, and say something about their
  differences.
  <i><br>boolean: either true or false (1byte).
    <br>char: a single Unicode character (2bytes).
    <br>byte, short, int, long: integers of various sizes (1, 2, 4, 8 bytes).
    <br>float, double: floats of various precisions (4, 8 bytes).</i>

  <li> What is the difference between an <b>expression</b> and a <b>statement</b>?
  Give an example of each.
  <i><br>Expression: returns a result for use in a larger expression or statement.
    Example: 2 + 3
    <br>Statement: stands alone as a command to be executed.
    Example: x = 2 + 3</i>

</ol>

<h2><a name="3">HW3 (due Thu 17 Feb) (10pts)</a></h2><ol>
  <li> A programming style that uses a <b>signal and response</b> approach to 
  programming is called: <i>(c)</i> <u>[1]</u> <ol class="subparts">
    <li>Object Oriented Programming
    <li>Structured Programming
    <li>Event-driven Programming
    <li>Bottom-up Programming
  </ol>
  <li> A <b>button</b> component should have a registered 
  _____________ associated with it. <i>(c)</i> <u>[1]</u> <ol class="subparts">
    <li>pixel
    <li>JFrame
    <li>listener
    <li>none of the above
  </ol>
  <li> The _____________ manager places components into <b>five regions</b>.
  <i>(a)</i> <u>[1]</u> <ol class="subparts">
    <li> BorderLayout
    <li> FlowLayout
    <li> GridLayout
    <li> AbsoluteLayout
  </ol>
  <li> A _____________ is an object that is a simple <b>container</b> class 
  that groups other objects. <i>(a)</i>  <u>[1]</u> <ol class="subparts">
    <li> JPanel
    <li> JMenu
    <li> JButton
    <li> JTextArea
  </ol>
  <li> Explain the <b>model-view-controller</b> pattern when applied to 
  a typical GUI.  <u>[3]</u>
  <i><br>The model-view-controller pattern when applied to the task of
    designing a GUI allows the task to be divided into two main subtasks:  1)
    Designing and coding the appearance of the GUI on the screen; 2) Designing
    and coding the actions performed in response to button clicks and other
    user actions.  This approach allows GUI components to send messages to
    determine which actions should be taken.  </i>
  <li> Name and describe all the <b>classes</b> involved with writing a
  serializable object out to the file "output.txt". <u>[3]</u>
  <i><br>File takes the string filename and looks it up in the filesystem.
    <br>FileOutputStream takes the File object and opens the file for
    writing binary data.
    <br>ObjectOutputStream takes the FileOutputStream and prepares it for
    writing out serialized objects.</i>
</ol>

<h2><a name="4">HW4 (due Thu 24 Mar) (20pts)</a></h2><ol>

    <li> Graphics <i>Answer</i>
    <li> Image
    <li> String

    <li> paint()
    <li> repaint() <i>Answer</i>
    <li> update()
    <li> all of the above
  </ol>
  <li> The programming statements used to accomplish a thread's task should be
  included in the method: <u>[1]</u> <ol class="subparts">
    <li> start()
    <li> init()
    <li> run() <i>Answer</i>
    <li> none of the above
  </ol>
  <li> When a server executes the <tt>accept()</tt> method it:
  <u>[1]</u> <ol class="subparts">
    <li> Blocks and waits for a connection <i>Answer</i>
    <li> Checks for a connection and if there is none it exits
    <li> Blocks but in a new thread
    <li> Any of the above, depending on the input parameters to accept()
  </ol>
</ol>

<h2><a name="5">HW5 (due Thu  7 Apr) (20pts)</a></h2><ol>
  <li> What is an Android <b>Activity</b>?  Is it the same as an application?
  Discuss the relationship between an Activity and an app. <u>[5]</u>
  <i><br>An Activity presents the user interface for a single task; e.g.,
    a single screen or dialog in an application.  Apps generally are composed
    of several Activities, and/or BackgroundServices, ContentProviders, 
    BroadcastListeners.</i>
  <li> Name and describe the four states of an Activity's <b>lifecycle</b>.
  <u>[6]</u>
  <i><br>Active (running in foreground), paused (e.g., blocked by a pop-up 
    dialog), stopped (no longer visible), dead (removed by OS)</i>
  <li> Describe how to design an Android application which is 
  <b>internationalization</b>-ready (i.e., its text can be easily translated).
  <u>[5]</u>
  <i><br>Put all user-visible strings in a separate strings.xml file and refer
    to them in your code (or object properties) only via resource IDs.
    To create a translation, make another version of the strings.xml which
    contains the translated strings.  Then the system can select the appropriate
    version of the strings at runtime.</i>
  <li> Name and describe two <b>Creational</b> design patterns from the 
  "Gang of Four" (GoF) book. <u>[4]</u>
  <i><br>Factory Method (abstract constructor), Abstract Factory (hierarchy of
    factory classes to create objects), Builder (director delegates construction
    to a set of builders), Prototype (clone an existing object to make more),
    and Singleton (only one instance of the class is allowed).</i>
