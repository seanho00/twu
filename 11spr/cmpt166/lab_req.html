<h1><a href="http://twu.seanho.com/11spr/cmpt166/">
    CMPT166 Spring 2011</a> Lab Requirements</h1>

<h2>Complete all labs</h2>

<p><b>Every</b> lab must be done; no exceptions!  But the late policy is fairly
lenient; <a href="syllabus.html">see the syllabus for details</a>.

<h2>Lab write-up</h2>

<p>Every lab must be accompanied by a lab write-up.
<a href="lab0/Ho_Sean_Lab0.html">A template write-up is available</a>; it is a
slightly modified version of the CMPT140 lab write-ups.  Have at least
something in every section.

<p> Your write-up file should be named <tt>Last_First_Lab0.doc</tt>.
(Replace "Last" with your last name, "First" with your first name, "Lab0" with
the appropriate lab number, and ".doc" with the appropriate file extension.)


<h2>Code doc-comments and style</h2>

<p><a href="lab0/Addition.java">See the sample Java code file for what is
expected in terms of comments, doc-comments (docstrings), and style.</a>

<p>
We will try to follow 
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html">
the JavaDoc standard</a> and
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconvtoc-136057.html">
the Sun Java code conventions</a>.
You may also wish to use other javadoc keywords like @see or {@link}.
Each method should also have its own doc comment, including a short
description, preconditions (@param javadoc keyword), and postconditions
(@return keyword).

<h2>Electronic submission</h2>
<p>
Upload the following to <a href="https://courses.mytwu.ca/">MyCourses</a>,
under the appropriate dropbox for the lab:<ul>
  <li> Lab write-up: e.g., <tt>Last_First_Lab0.doc</tt>
  <li> Java source code: e.g., <tt>Addition.java</tt>
  <li> Compiled Java bytecode: e.g., <tt>Addition.class</tt>
  <li> Any screenshots, images, text, or other data files.
</ul>
The TA needs to be able to recompile and run your program; it is your 
responsibility to ensure that your code works for the TA!  This is
particularly pertinent if you are using your own install of the JDK on
your own laptop, instead of using the lab computers.

<p>
<a href="lab0/">Here is a sample directory containing all the files you'd need
to upload.</a>

<h2>Marking</h2>

<p>The weighting of marks for each lab will be approximately:<ul>
<li> 50%: Working code that satisfies all the requirements of the lab assignment.
<li> 10%: Code style: doc-comments, internal comments, variable/method names,
indentation, etc.
<li> 30%: Lab write-up (excluding test cases): design, pseudocode, user manual, etc.
<li> 10%: Testing
<li> 5-15%: Bonuses (if any)
</ul>
