<li> What does the acronym <b>CRUD</b> mean, in reference to
database systems? Describe an example application in which CRUD
might be useful.  <u>[4]</u>
<br><i>
  Create, Read, Update, Destroy: e.g., a student enrolment database:
  add a new student to the system, print out information on an existing
  student, change a student's information (name, GPA, etc.), and
  remove a student from the system (e.g., after graduation).

<li> Consider Java interfaces and abstract classes. <ol class="subparts">
  <li> What is an <b>interface</b> in Java?  Describe an example. <u>[3]</u>
  <br><i>
    An interface is a named set of methods, for instance the ActionListener
    interface specifies the actionPerformed() method and advertises that a class
    knows how to respond to action events.</i>
  <div class="answerbox" style="height:6em"></div>

  <li> What is an <b>abstract class</b>?  Describe an example. <u>[3]</u>
  <br><i>
    An abstract class is not meant to be instantiated directly. An abstract
    superclass can be used as a way of organizing its subclasses under one
    category. For example, Dog, Cat, and Cow all are within the Mammal category.
    It makes sense to have specific instances of Dog, Cat, and Cow, but not of
    Mammal. Mammal is the abstract superclass.</i>
  <div class="answerbox" style="height:6em"></div>

  <li> Describe the <b>differences</b> between interfaces and abstract classes.
    <u>[3]</u>
  <br><i>
    Interfaces specify functionality,
    i.e., what a class knows how to do.  Abstract superclasses specify identity,
    i.e., what a class is.  Multiple classes that inherit from different
    superclasses may implement the same interface, but in Java multiple
    inheritance is not permitted. </i>
  <div class="answerbox" style="height:8em"></div>
</ol>

<li> What is the effect of the <b><tt>static</tt></b> keyword on
attributes and methods?  Why must <tt>main()</tt> be declared static?
Describe another example of an appropriate use of 'static' on an
attribute or method.
<u>[5]</u>
<br><i>
  Static members belong to the whole class, rather than to each instance.
  Static methods can be invoked from the class without needing to instantiate
  the class.  <tt>main()</tt> has to be static because when it is run no
  objects have been instantiated yet.
  The String library has a number of static utility methods, e.g.,
  String.format().  Another example is the constant Math.PI.
</i>
<div class="answerbox" style="height:8em"></div>

<li> What is <b>event-driven programming</b>?  Describe an example
in detail. <u>[3]</u>
<br><i>
  Action happens in response to events.  Events may be user-triggered
  (e.g., click on button, or press a key), or may be synthetic (e.g., timer).
  Event handlers/listeners are connected to each object which may send events,
  and the listeners define what should happen when an event is received
  (i.e., the callbacks).
  E.g., when a user clicks on a JButton, an ActionEvent is sent.
  If the JButton has an ActionListener set, then that listener's
  actionPerformed() method is called.  When the callback completes,
  control returns to the main event loop, which waits for the next event.

<div class="answerbox" style="height:8em"></div>

<li> Name and briefly describe the features of at least 4
<b>Swing widgets</b> (i.e., subclasses of JComponent).
If you can't remember the exact name of the class, describe the
widget in as much detail as you can.  <u>[5]</u>
<br><i>Many to choose from: JPanel, JFrame, JButton,
  JCheckBox, JComboBox, JRadioButton, JLabel, JTextField, JPasswordField,
  JTextArea, JMenu, JMenuItem, JSlider, JProgressBar, ...

    <li> Describe all the relationships involving the Seminar class
    (top right) in the diagram.  Consider multiplicity. <u>[6]</u>
    <br><i>
      Each Seminar has at least one SeminarEnrollment object (which
      references a Student).  There can be any number of students
      on the waitlist.  There can be either 0 or 1 professors instructing
      the Seminar.  The Seminar is an offering of a Course (although
      there can be multiple Seminars for one Course).
    </i>
    <div class="answerbox" style="height:6em"></div>
    <li> What is the role of the SeminarEnrollment class?  Why not
    just have a direct relationship between Student and Seminar? <u>[3]</u>
    <br><i>
      The SeminarEnrollment object holds the info for a registered
      Student in a Seminar: e.g., that Student's marks.
      If the SeminarEnrollment class did not exist, the marks would
      have to be stored either in the Student (disconnected from the
      course) or in the Seminar (disconnected from the Student).

    <div class="answerbox" style="height:4em"></div>
    <li> What does the looping arrow below and to the right of the
    Professor class mean?  Consider multiplicity. <u>[3]</u>
    <br><i>
      Professors can mentor other Professors: one would be the advisor,
      and the other would be the associate.  Each Professor can be
      the advisor for any number of associates, but each associate may
      have at most one advisor.

<li> Consider Java copy constructors. <ol class="subparts">
  <li> What is a <b>copy constructor</b>, and what is it used for? <u>[3]</u>
  <br><i>A copy constructor performs deep copy: the one parameter is another object
    of the same type, and the copy constructor copies attributes from the other
    object into the current object.</i>
  <div class="answerbox" style="height:4em"></div>
  <li> On a separate page, implement in Java a <tt>Song</tt> class with
  attributes <tt>title</tt> (String), <tt>artist</tt> (String), and 
  <tt>year</tt> (int).  Write three constructors: one with no parameters, one
  with three parameters (String, String, float), and one that is a copy
  constructor.  Remember that 'String' is a class in Java, not a primitive type.
  <u>[5]</u>
  <br><i> See <a href="Song.java">Song.java</a>.  </i>
</ol>

<li> The task in this programming problem is to implement a complete
Java program using serialized I/O on the <tt>Song</tt> class you defined in
the previous question.
<br><br>
Your program should open the file "<tt>song.obj</tt>", which you can
assume contains one serialized Song (e.g., generated by your program previously).
Read in the Song object, append the year in parentheses to the title, and
store the object back to the same file.
<br><br>
For example, if the file "<tt>song.obj</tt>" previously contained a song with
title "Amazing Grace", artist "John Newton", and year 1779, then after your
program runs, the file should contain a song object that has a
title of "Amazing Grace (1779)".
<br><br>
You do need to worry about exceptions that could be raised.
You do not need any keyboard/console I/O.
You may need to modify your <tt>Song</tt> class slightly.
Docstrings and comments are not necessary but may be good for partial
credit.

Some standard Java classes you may find helpful:
<tt>File, FileInputStream/FileOutputStream, 
  ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream</tt>.
Don't worry about importing (i.e., assume all relevant imports are already done).
