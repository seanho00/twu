<h1><a href="http://twu.seanho.com/11spr/cmpt166/">
    CMPT 166 Spring 2011</a> Lab Assignments</h1>

<div>All labs must include a lab write-up and will be marked
  according to <a href="lab_req.html">the lab requirements</a>.</div>

<h2><a name="1">Lab 1: Flow of Control (due Thu 20 Jan) (40pts)</a></h2>

Java text (Savitch), p.162-164: choose one of #2, #5, or #8.
(#8: also generate or come up with your own cryparithmetic puzzle)

<h2><a name="2">Lab 2: Classes (due Tue  1 Feb) (40pts)</a></h2>

Java text (Savitch), p.247-248: choose one of #2 (Fraction), #3
(Odometer), #4 (BlogEntry), or #6 (StudentGrades).
<ul>
<li>In each case, you should have at least two classes: one which is
your solution to the lab, including attributes, constructor, and other
methods (e.g., Fraction), and another class which tests your main class
(e.g., FractionTest).  The testbed class can have several methods in it;
you may use this for unit-testing each method in your main class.
<li>Your class should have at least: attributes (made private as appropriate),
constructors, set/get methods (including a toString() method), 
plus whatever other methods are needed to meet the requirements.
<li>Provide constructors that take various different arguments to initialize
attributes, plus a constructor that doesn't need any arguments (choose default
values), plus a "copy constructor" that takes another object of the same type.
</ul>

<h2><a name="3">Lab 3: Inheritance (due Thu 10 Feb) (40pts)</a></h2>

Java text (Savitch), p.469-472: choose one of #3 (Alien), #6 (Truck),
#7 (Patient), or p.509 #4 (predator-prey).

The last option (p.509 #4) is worth up to 5 pts extra credit (45 total)
if done correctly and completely.

<ul>
  <li> For all options (this lab only),
  provide detailed JUnit4 <b>unit-tests</b> for all classes
  and all public methods (You do not need to do unit tests for private/protected
  methods.)  For example, unit tests for Truck and Vehicle would go in
  TruckTest and VehicleTest.
  <li> Write your test cases based on the pre-conditions and post-conditions for
  your methods.  Think about valid and invalid values for parameters.
  <li> Try to be exhaustive in your test cases -- if any bugs creep into the 
  code for the main classes, then the unit tests ought to be able to catch them!
  You can have multiple assertions within each test case.
  <li> Files to upload: <ul>
    <li> Parent.java, Parent.class (or whatever you've called your superclass)
    <li> Child.java, Child.class (or whatever you've called your subclass)
    <li> ParentTest.java, ParentTest.class
    <li> ChildTest.java, ChildTest.class
    <li> Write-up (doc, odt, pdf, html, txt, etc.)
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2><a name="4">Lab 4: CRUD Database (due Tue  1 Mar) (40pts)</a></h2>

Create a simple database!  ch10 p.637 #10 or #11, or a similar project of
your own design.<ul>
  <li> Your program should provide
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">"CRUD"</a>
  functionality -- this means that (at a minimum) the user should be able to: <ul>
    <li> <b>(C)reate</b> new records,
    <li> <b>(R)ead</b> (display) existing records,
    <li> <b>(U)pdate</b> (modify) an existing record, and
    <li> <b>(D)elete</b> an existing record.
  </ul>
  <li> This also means you need to provide a way for the user to <b>search</b>
  the database in various ways (e.g., by first name, by phone#, by title) so 
  the user can select which entry to read/update/delete.
  <li> You should also allow the user to create an <b>empty</b> database,
  <b>save</b> the database to file,
  and <b>load</b> a previously-saved database from file.
  <li> What is stored in the database is up to you -- list of people, list of
  songs, list of ski resorts, list of creatures, etc.
  <li> Define a <b>class</b> to represent a single record -- e.g., Person,
  Song, SkiResort, Creature, etc.  Make this class serializable and
  use <b>object-based I/O</b> for the loading/saving of the database.
  <li> To store the list of records in memory, you may use either an
  <b>array</b> (but then you have to worry about the size of the array)
  or an <b>ArrayList</b> (see ch14 for details).
  <li> You do not need exhaustive JUnit unit-tests, but provide a simple
  <b>testbed</b> program that clearly shows off all the functionality you
  worked so hard to put in your program.
</ul>

<h2><a name="5">Lab 5: Swing (due Tue 22 Mar) (40pts)</a></h2>

Develop your own <b>GUI</b> program using Java Swing!  Here are the requirements:
<ul>
  <li> It must be a <b>cohesive</b> program with a clear <b>purpose</b>
  (i.e., not just a technology demo of Swing widgets).
  <li> It must make extensive use of Java <b>Swing</b> for the GUI: this
  includes <b>widgets</b> (buttons, menus, and/or text boxes) 
  and use of a <b>layout manager</b>.
  <li> It must be <b>interactive</b>: you may use ActionListener or another
  EventListener interface (e.g., MouseListener, MouseMotionListener).
  <li> The design of the UI should be <b>user-friendly</b>, easy to use, and
  not unbearably ugly.  An average non-programmer computer user should be
  able to figure out the controls even without help text.
  <li> Have <b>fun</b> and make it cool!
</ul>

Suggestions for possible project ideas: <ul>
  <li> "Memory game": click on cards to turn them over; match pairs of cards to
  clear them from the board.
  <li> Calculator: either RPN or build an expression.
  <li> Fast food ordering kiosk: select meals, options; get a total bill.
  <li> GUI for your Lab4 database.
</ul>

<h2><a name="6">Lab 6: Android or TCP/IP (due Tue 12 Apr, with
    in-class presentations) (40+10pts)</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li> Choose one of the following two options, either Android or TCP/IP client-server.
  <li> On Tue 12 Apr, you will demonstrate one of your projects in-class, in the senior lab!
  You may demonstrate any one of your labs, but you want to choose something cool to show.
  If you don't want to use the lab computers, you may demonstrate it on your own laptop.
  The presentation counts for the last 10pts of the project.
  <li> Be creative and make it interesting!  (That's part of the assignment!)
</ul>

<h3>Android</h3>

Write a cool Android application!  You may demonstrate it on the software emulator.
If you like, you may also demonstrate it running on an Android phone (either my
phone, or your own)!

<p>
We might not have time in-class to get very far on Android, but there are many
resources to help you learn Android on <a href="http://d.android.com/">the
  Android developer site</a>:<ul>
  <li> Start with <a href="http://d.android.com/guide/developing/eclipse-adt.html">
    how to get+use the Android Developer Kit with Eclipse</a> (this is not provided
  in the senior lab; you have to install it on your own computer).
  <li> You may then want to try the 
  <a href="http://d.android.com/resources/tutorials/hello-world.html">Hello World</a>
  tutorial just to see what a running Android program looks like.
  <li> The complete "book" on developing for Android is 
  <a href="http://d.android.com/guide/">the Developer's Guide</a>.
  <li> To supplement the book, you may enjoy watching 
  <a href="http://d.android.com/videos/index.html#v=QBGfUs9mQYY">the Androidology
    series of videos</a> giving an overview of the Android software architecture.
  <li> If you've seen 
  <a href="http://appinventor.googlelabs.com/about/">Android App Inventor</a>,
  you may also use that to build a cool Android app.  However, it does not 
  produce editable Java code!  The programming environment is a visual one 
  called <a href="http://scratched.media.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, designed to be 
  easy for high-schoolers to learn.
  If you elect to use App Inventor for this lab, you are responsible for
  figuring out how to install and use it on your own computer.
</ul>

<h3>TCP/IP Client-Server</h3>

Come up with your own cool client-server network application (e.g., chat/IM,
stock-ticker, sending pictures, web server)!

<ul>
<li> Your application should have
(at least) two running programs, one for the server and one for the client.
<li> Both should have Swing GUIs that use multithreading to keep the GUI
responsive (non-blocking).
<li> Your server should use multithreading to handle multiple clients simultaneously (demonstrate this).
<li> The messages you send over the network may be either plain-text or serialized objects.
<li> To facilitate running the demo, please make it easy to change the server and port,
on both the client and server (e.g., without recompiling).
<li> You may try your applications on two different computers in the lab!
Use ports 4410 and/or 4411.

</ul>
