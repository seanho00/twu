<li> What do you think of the <b>Java</b> programming language overall?
Compare it to another language you know. <u>[4]</u>
<div class="answerbox" style="height:6em"></div>

<li> What is <b>object-oriented</b> programming?  How does it differ
from procedural programming? <u>[4]</u>
<div class="answerbox" style="height:5em"></div>
<i><br>
  Procedural programming is action-oriented: the code is a sequence of
  procedures, and the data structures are passed as parameters to the
  procedures. The focus is on the 'verbs'. In contrast, object-oriented
  programming is data-oriented: code is organized into classes, centred
  around objects, and the procedures are treated as methods within each
  class. The focus is on the 'nouns'.
</i>

<li> Describe and contrast the four options we have in Java for 
<b>access modifiers</b> on attributes/methods. <u>[4]</u>
<div class="answerbox" style="height:5em"></div>
<i><dl>
<dt> <tt>private</tt> <dd> only methods in this class can access
<dt> (no modifier) <dd> methods in this class and this package can access
<dt> <tt>protected</tt> <dd> also subclasses can access
<dt> <tt>public</tt> <dd> anyone can access
</dl></i>

<li> What is the effect of the <b><tt>final</tt></b> keyword on
  <ul class="subparts">
  <li> instance variables? <u>[2]</u>
  <i><br>Constant: cannot change the value of the variable</i>
  <div class="answerbox" style="height:1em"></div>

  <li> methods? <u>[2]</u>
  <i><br>Subclasses cannot override (redefine) the method</i>
  <div class="answerbox" style="height:1em"></div>

  <li> classes? <u>[2]</u>
  <i><br>Cannot be subclassed</i>
  <div class="answerbox" style="height:1em"></div>
</ul>

<li> What is an <b>interface</b> in Java?  What is an <b>abstract class</b>?
What's the difference?  Describe an example of each (you may come up with your
own).  <u>[6]</u>
<i><br>
  An abstract class is not meant to be instantiated directly. An abstract
  superclass can be used as a way of organizing its subclasses under one
  category. For example, Dog, Cat, and Cow all are within the Mammal category.
  It makes sense to have specific instances of Dog, Cat, and Cow, but not of
  Mammal. Mammal is the abstract superclass.<br>
  An interface is a named set of methods, for instance the ActionListener
  interface specifies the actionPerformed() method and advertises that a class
  knows how to respond to action events.  Interfaces specify functionality,
  i.e., what a class knows how to do.  Abstract superclasses specify identity,
  i.e., what a class is.  Multiple classes that inherit from different
  superclasses may implement the same interface, but in Java multiple
  inheritance is not permitted.
</i>

<div class="break"></div>

<li> Name and briefly describe the features of at least 4
<b>Swing widgets</b> (i.e., subclasses of JComponent).
If you can't remember the exact name of the class, describe the
widget in as much detail as you can.  <u>[8]</u>
<br><i>Many to choose from: JPanel, JFrame, JButton,
  JCheckBox, JComboBox, JRadioButton, JLabel, JTextField, JPasswordField,
  JTextArea, JMenu, JMenuItem, JSlider, JProgressBar, ...
</i>
<div class="answerbox" style="height:10em"></div>

<li> What is object <b>serialization</b> in Java?  Describe
a situation where serialization might be useful. <u>[4]</u>
<i><br>
  Serialization converts Java objects into byte streams that can be sent across
  any I/O channel. Objects can be serialized if their classes implement the
  Serializable interface and if all its non-transient instance variables are
  serializable. Primitive types (int, char, etc.) and arrays of primitive types
  are serializable. Any kind of inter-process communication may benefit from
  object serialization: e.g., a client-server restaurant ordering system may
  wish to send objects that represent customer orders over a network I/O
  channel.
</i>
<div class="answerbox" style="height:8em"></div>

<li> What is a <b>component framework</b>?  Why are they cool?  Describe one
such framework in detail (it need not even be computer-related). Describe
a couple example components and what you could do with them. <u>[5]</u>
<div class="answerbox" style="height:8em"></div>

<li>What is an Android <b>Activity</b>?  Is it a complete application?
Describe an example.  <u>[4]</u>
<i><br>
  An Activity is the UI for one focused user endeavour, e.g., one screen
  or dialogue window.
  Android applications may be composed of multiple Activities, background
  Services, BroadcastReceivers, and ContentProvider databases.
</i>
<div class="answerbox" style="height:8em"></div>

<li> Why do Android applications not have a <b>main()</b> method? <u>[3]</u>
<i><br>
  Modular component architecture: applications are not monolithic but
  may have several entry points.  This is so other apps can directly call
  individual Activities within the application, rather than having to go
  through main().
</i>

<div class="break"></div>

<li> What are Android <b>string resources</b>?  Why are they cool? <u>[4]</u>
<i><br>
  Name-value pairs, stored in res/values/strings.xml.  In the code or
  UI layout, refer to strings via their resource IDs, rather than hard-coding
  them in.  This facilitates localization/translation into other languages.
</i>
<div class="answerbox" style="height:6em"></div>

<li> Design a <b>class hierarchy</b> of your own choosing, with
an abstract superclass and at least two concrete subclasses.
  <ol class="subparts">
    <li> Design attributes and methods appropriate for each class and
    draw a UML <b>class diagram</b>. <u>[5]</u>
    <div class="answerbox" style="height:16em"></div>

    <li> Design a method that takes advantage of the <b>polymorphism</b>
    in this class hierarchy, and explain how it does so.
    The polymorphic method need not live inside any of the classes. <u>[4]</u>
    <div class="answerbox" style="height:5em"></div>
  </ol>

<li> For each of the three categories of <b>design patterns</b> in the
"Gang of Four" book, name at least three example patterns (for a total
of nine patterns).  For each pattern you choose, describe it in words and give
an example or analogy illustrating it.
  <ol class="subparts">
    <li> <b>Creational</b>: <u>[5]</u>
    <i><br>factory method, abstract factory, prototype, singleton </i>

<div class="break"></div>

    <li> <b>Structural</b>: <u>[5]</u>
    <i><br> facade, adapter, bridge, proxy, decorator, flyweight</i>
    <div class="answerbox" style="height:10em"></div>

    <li> <b>Behavioural</b>: <u>[5]</u>
    <i><br>observer, mediator, chain of responsibility, iterator, 
      memento, command </i>
    <div class="answerbox" style="height:10em"></div>
  </ol>

<li> Write a complete Java program that reads in a file "input.txt",
removes all <b>digits</b>, and outputs the result in the file "output.txt".
Include full <b>doc-comments</b> with pre-/post-conditions.  <u>[8]</u>
<i><br>
  (See <a href="StripDigits.java">StripDigits.java</a>.)
</i>

<li> A <b><tt>BankTransaction</tt></b> consists of an account number, date,
dollar amount, and a flag that indicates whether it was a withdrawal or deposit.
  <ol class="subparts">
    <li> Write a complete Java <b>class</b> defining a BankTransaction,
    including attributes and two constructors (one with a full set of
    parameters, and one with no parameters at all).  Be sure to do
    error-checking of all input parameters.  To keep things simple, no set/get
    functions are required.
    <br>The <tt>java.util.Date</tt> class stores a date/time object; the
    default constructor returns the current date/time.  <u>[6]</u>
    <i><br>
      (See <a href="BankTransaction.java">BankTransaction.java</a>.)
    </i>

    <li> Add a <b>copy constructor</b> to the implementation.
    Check for null references and other errors.  <u>[4]</u>
  </ol>

<li> Design a console-based networked <b>chatroom</b> in Java.
Users may be able to join and leave the chatroom, and any line of text entered
by any user is broadcast to all other users.
What <b>classes</b> will you need?  What <b>methods</b> might those classes
have?  Describe how you would handle having <b>multiple users</b> connected
at the same time.  Describe in detail what should happen when a new user
tries to connect to the chatroom.  <u>[8]</u>

<li> We wish to design a system that tracks the location of 
<b>public buses</b> in real-time and updates displays at bus stops
informing riders of how long they'll need to wait for the next bus.
Draw a UML <b>use-case</b> diagram for this system. <u>[8]</u>
