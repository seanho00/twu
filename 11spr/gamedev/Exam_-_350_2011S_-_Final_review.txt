(tentative) Test composition
- somewhere between a third and a half of the questions will come from the readings (including material we have read but not discussed in class!), the rest coming from what we have talked about in class.  Not every reading will necessarily be touched on, but we’ll try to cover as much as we can.
- the exam will be a mix of question types.  Probably about 1/3 of the points will come from quick-answer questions (multiple choice, matching, maybe fill in the blank), about 1/3 of the points will come from short answer questions, and about 1/3 of the points will come from longer form questions.
- some of the questions will be focused on recalling information, but as much as possible, the questions will be application and evaluation questions
- the exam is supposed to take about 45-60 minutes for average-speed test-takers—in other words, it’s a little lighter than the typical final (reflecting its reduced value to your grade).

Study strategies
- memorization is less important than understanding and being able to explain things.  However, it’s always best to be able to remember as much as possible.
- Get some rest and eat well.  A rested body is worth several hours of frantic and unfocused studying.
