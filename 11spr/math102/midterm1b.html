<li> Say that in a certain town 63% of the people vote Conservative, 
and the probability that a townsperson drives a large truck is 4/7.
If you pick a random townsperson, there is a 27% chance that the townsperson
is a Conservative driving a large truck. <ol class="subparts">

  <li> What fraction of Conservatives in this town drive large trucks?
  <u>[3]</u>
  <i><br>Let C = Conservative, T = drives a large truck.<br>
    P(T|C) = P(T and C) / P(C) = .27 / .63 = 3/7 &asymp; 42.85%.</i>
  <div class="answerbox" style="height:2em"></div>

  <li> In this town, is voting Conservative <b>mutually exclusive</b>
  of driving a large truck?  Why or why not? <u>[1]</u>
  <i><br>No, P(T and C) = .27 &gt; 0, so there is an overlap;
    there are townspeople who are both Conservative and drive large trucks.</i>
  <div class="answerbox" style="height:2em"></div>

  <li> In this town, is voting Conservative <b>independent</b> of driving a 
  large truck?  Why or why not? Interpret what this means in the context
  of the townspeople.<u>[3]</u>
  <i><br> P(T|C) = 3/7 &ne; 4/7 = P(T), so the two events are not independent.
    <p>
    Overall, 4/7 of the townspeople drive large trucks.  But within the
    Conservative townspeople, only 3/7 drive large trucks; the Conservatives
    are less likely to be driving large trucks than non-Conservatives
    (perhaps a surprising result!).

  <li> The small business association is a randomly-selected group of

    (or z = (25.5-31.5)/3.414 &asymp; -1.76 if using continuity correction)
    <br>(T3): area between x=25 and mean is 47.13%, so 
    area to right of x=25 is 50+47.13% = 97.13%

<li> Suppose that when a job candidate comes to interview for a staff position
at TWU, the probability that he or she will want the job (A) after the
interview is 70%.  The probability that TWU wants the candidate (B) is 40%.
Also, P(A|B)=0.90. 
<ol class="subparts">

  <li> Find P(A &cap; B), draw a <b>Venn</b> diagram, and <b>interpret</b> it in words.
  <u>[3]</u>
  <i><br>This is the intersection: P(A &cap; B) = P(B)P(A|B) = (.40)(.90) = 36%.
    <br>Out of all the candidates who come to interview, 36% are liked by TWU
    and like TWU; i.e., 36% of interviews result in the candidate taking the job.</i>
  <div class="answerbox" style="height:6em"></div>

  <li> Find P(B | A), and <b>interpret</b> it in words.  <u>[3]</u>
  <i><br>P(B|A) = P(A &cap; B) / P(A) = .36 / .70 &asymp; 51.43%.
    <br>Just over half of the candidates who like TWU are also liked by TWU.</i>
  <div class="answerbox" style="height:4em"></div>

  <li> Are events A and B <b>independent</b>?  Explain.  Interpret (in the 
  context of job interviews) what it means for A and B to be independent. <u>[2]</u>
  <i><br>P(A|B) = 90% &ne; 70% = P(A), so A and B are not independent.
    The probability that a candidate wants the job is different depending
    on whether TWU likes the candidate or not.
    In particular, if TWU wants the candidate, it is more likely that the
    candidate also wants the job (this isn't saying anything about 
    <b>causality</b>, just correlation).</i>

An assay (test) measuring inorganic phosphate in blood is imprecise, with
values normally distributed around the true phosphate concentration, with a 
standard deviation of 0.2 mmol/L.  Blood phosphate values of over 1.6 mmol/L are
considered "high".<ol class="subparts">

  <li> What is the probability that this assay returns a result <b>within</b>
  &plusmn;0.15 mmol/L of the true value? <u>[2]</u>
  <i><br>[z = &plusmn;.15/.2 = &plusmn;0.75, area = 2(27.34%) = 54.68%]</i>
  <div class="answerbox" style="height:3em"></div>

  <li> If the true concentration of phosphate is 1.45 mmol/L
  (not "high"), what is the probability that the assay could still return a
  value that is considered "<b>high</b>"? <u>[2]</u>
  <i><br>[z = (1.6-1.45)/.2 = 0.75, area to the right = 0.5 - 0.2734 = 22.66%]</i>
  <div class="answerbox" style="height:3em"></div>

  <li> The standard deviation is just one way of measuring the dispersion
  (imprecision) of the assay results.  The <b>interquartile range (IQR)</b> is
  another.  Find the IQR for this assay. <u>[3]</u>
  <i><br>Q3: area = 25%, so (T3) z= 0.67 (or 0.68).
    <br>Hence (x-&mu;) = z(&sigma;) = (0.67)(0.2) = 0.134.
    <br>Similarly for Q1, so IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 2(0.134) = 0.268 (or 0.272)</i>
