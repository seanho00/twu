<ol class="main">

<li> An experiment measured the mass of a certain variety of caterpillars
after 3 weeks, in different temperatures.  The results are shown below:
<br>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
<tr><th>Temp (C)</th>
<td>15</td><td>18</td><td>21</td>
<td>21</td><td>23</td><td>28</td></tr>
<tr><th>Mass (g)</th>
<td>1.8</td><td>2.2</td><td>3.2</td>
<td>2.8</td><td>3.7</td><td>3.1</td></tr>
</table>

<ol class="subparts">
<li> What is the average temperature and average mass in the study sample?
<br><br> 
<i>xbar = 21, ybar = 2.8
</i><br><br>

<li> Calculate SS(x), SS(y), and SS(xy).
<br><br>
<i> SS(x) = 98, SS(y) = 2.42, SS(xy) = 11.7
</i><br><br>

<li> Find the sample correlation r.
<br><br>
<i> r = SS(xy)/sqrt(SS(x) SS(y)) &cong; 0.75974 &cong; 0.76
</i><br><br>

<li> Construct a 95% confidence interval on the correlation.
<br><br>
<i> n = 6: about -0.05 &lt; &rho; &lt; 0.96.
</i><br><br>

<li> At a level of significance of &alpha; = 0.05, is caterpillar mass
correlated with temperature?
<br><br>
<i> df = n-2 = 4: 0.05 &lt; p &lt; 0.10: fail to reject H<sub>0</sub>;
insufficient evidence to show caterpillar mass is correlated with temperature.
</i><br><br>

<li> Find the equation of the best-fit line.
<br><br>
<i>b1 = SS(xy)/SS(x) &cong; 0.1194, b0 = 0.2929.<br>
Best-fit line is y = 0.2929 + 0.1194 x.
</i><br><br>

<li> What does the linear model predict should be the mass of caterpillars
grown at a temperature of 25 C?
<br><br>
<i>y = 0.2929 + 0.1194 * 25 &cong; 3.2776 grams.
</i><br><br>

<li> Find SSE, the sum of squared errors (residuals).
<br><br>
<i>SSE = 1.0232.
</i><br><br>

<li> What are the assumptions of the linear model?
<br><br>
<i>Assumes that the sample is a random sample representative of the
population.  Assumes that the mass of caterpillars is normally distributed
with a mean that depends upon the temperature according to the best-fit line
and a standard deviation that does not depend on temperature.
</i><br><br>

<li> What does the linear model predict is the standard deviation of
mass of caterpillars grown at a temperature of 25 C?
<br><br>
<i>s<sub>e</sub> = sqrt(SSE/(n-2)) &cong; 0.5058.
</i><br><br>

<li> Find SE<sub>b1</sub>, the standard error of estimate of the 
slope (b1) of the best-fit line.
<br><br>
<i>SE<sub>b1</sub> = s<sub>e</sub> / sqrt(SS(x)) &cong; 0.0511
</i><br><br>

<li> At a level of significance of &alpha; = 0.02, is the slope of the
best-fit line positive?
<br><br>
<i>t = (b1 - 0) / SE<sub>b1</sub> &cong; 2.34.
<br>df = n-2 = 4, one-tailed: 0.025 &lt; p &lt; 0.05
<br>fail to reject H<sub>0</sub>: insufficient evidence to show that
the slope of the best-fit regression line for mass and temperature
is positive.
