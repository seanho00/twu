<P>32. Write an algorithm in pseudocode to write out the first twenty squares. Use a loop.</P>
<P>33. Write an algorithm in pseudocode to test whether a number is even or odd.</P>
<P>34. What is the output of the pseudocode:</P>
<PRE>	for i = 1 to 10
		for j = 1 to i
			write the value of i
			write a comma and a space
			write the value of j
		go to the next line
		end <!--"-->&quot;for j<!--"-->&quot; loop
	end <!--"-->&quot;for i<!--"-->&quot; loop</PRE>

<P>35. Write an algorithm in pseudocode to add the squares of the first n positive integers, where the number n is determined by asking the user of the program.</P>
<P>36. Write an algorithm in pseudocode to add ten numbers, each of which is typed by the user.</P>
<P>37. Write an algorithm in pseudocode to add n numbers, each of which is typed by the user. The user must first be asked for n.</P>
<P>38. Modify the algorithm in #37 to add the squares of the numbers as well as the numbers themselves in separate totals.</P>
<P>39. Write an algorithm in pseudocode to sort three numbers in order from smallest to largest.</P>
<P>40. The following piece of pseudo-code is meant to be an algorithm to compute the average of a sequence of real numbers. However, it will not work as shown. Make one correction so that it will.</P>
<PRE>	Compute Average
		read n (* number of reals to do *)
		set count to 1
		set partial sum to 0
		while count <!--<-->&lt;= n
			read currentReal
			add currentReal to partial sum
			add 1 to count
		end while
		set average to partial sum/ count
		write out average
	end Compute average</PRE>

<P>41. Write an algorithm to find the largest and the smallest number of a sequence of numbers.</P>
<P>42. Combine the corrected algorithm for #40 and #41 to produce a single piece of pseudo code to examine a sequence of numbers and determine the largest, smallest, and average of the numbers.</P>
<P>43. A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, such as:</P>
<PRE>	1	4	9	-7	6
	3	2	89	5	34
	1	-56	7	8	13</PRE>

<P>	This particular one is a three row by five column matrix. Write an algorithm for adding together all the cells of the matrix.</P>
<P>44. Generalize the pseudo code for the last problem by having the number of rows and the number of columns as named constants <I>numrows</I> <!--& -->&amp; <I>numcols</I> rather than as specific numbers (three and five.)</P>
<P>45. You have a column of numbers a<sub>1</SUB>, a<sub>2</SUB>, a<sub>3</SUB> through a<sub>12</SUB> that represent the monthly profits of your organization. You want to project these to the following year by adding 5% to each one and putting the result into another column numbered b<sub>1</SUB>, b<sub>2</SUB>,... through b<sub>12</SUB>. Write the pseudocode for this. (Note that the two columns constitute a matrix.)</P>
<P>46. You have three columns of numbers labelled revenue, expense and net profit. Each row is numbered 1,2,3,... lastItemNumber. Assume the first two columns are already filled in with data. Write the pseudocode to construct the third.</P>
<P>47. As in #46 above, but the columns are labelled price, GST (tax) and total. Only the first column is filled in. The second is constructed by finding 7% of the number in the first, and the third by taking the total  of the first two.  Write pseudocode to do this.</P>
<P>48. There are five columns of numbers labelled first, second, third, max, and average. The rows are numbered 1,2,3,... lastItemNumber. The first four columns are filled in. Write the pseudocode to fill in the last two columns of each row with the maximum and average of the first three in that row.</P>
<P>49. As in #48 above, but there are only three columns labelled first, second, and third. Write the pseudocode to obtain those numbers from a user and to put them into sorted order in the table. You can do this in one combined piece of code, or in two stages.</P>
<P>50. A vector is an array of numbers that has only one row (or column, as the case may be). If two vectors have the same length, their dot product is defined as the sum of the products of their respective components. That is, the dot product of (2, 3, 5) with (1, -7, 9) is 2 + (-21) + 45, a total of 26. Write the pseudocode to read in the values of two vectors, check to see if they are the same length, and if so, compute their dot product. If not output an error message.</P>
