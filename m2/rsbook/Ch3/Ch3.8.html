<P>Sometimes, the solution to a problem appears to call for a loop, but closer analysis reveals that the loop can be replaced by a single formula.  When this can be done, the code is much more efficient, for just the one formula is evaluated with just a few calculations, rather than many passes through a loop, with one or more computations each time.  This situation is common when the repeated computations follow a pattern of some kind.  An initial example (and others will be pointed out later in the text) comes from the study of sequences and series, which arise naturally in a variety of applications of mathematics, especially in business</P>
<H3><A NAME="Arithseq"></A><B>Problem:</B></H3>
<P>Find the sum of the first 1000 positive integers.</P>
<H3><B>Discussion:</B></H3>
<P>The simplest approach, and one that might be hoped for by a primary teacher trying to keep a bright student out of his way for a while, would be to perform 999 additions, using the pseudocode:</P>
<PRE>
  set the sum to zero
  set the current number to one
  while the current number is less than 1000
    add the current number to the sum
    increase the current number
  print the result</PRE>

<P>A more enterprising student might notice that if the numbers are written down twice, the second underneath the first and backward, the result can be obtained much more quickly:</P>
<PRE>
Sum   =    1 +    2 +    3 +    4 + ...
Sum   = 1000 +  999 +  998 +  997 + ...
2*Sum = 1001 + 1001 + 1001 + 1001 + ...  (1000 times)
</PRE><P>Thus twice the desired sum is 1000 <!--¥-->* 1001, so the actual sum is half this amount.  In general therefore, the sum of the first n positive integers can be found by evaluating the formula </P>

<P><IMG SRC="Figure/Eq3.8.1.GIF"><!----></P>
<P>More generally still, one can observe that the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... is just a particular instance of a class of such sequences with a defined starting point and specific amount by which each term is incremented to get the next.  Others include:</P>
<PRE>
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...
23, 31, 39, 47, ...
100, 201, 302, 403, ...</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I><A NAME="Arithmetic">A</A> sequence a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>, a<sub>4</sub>, ... of terms in which there is a fixed common difference d between successive terms is called an <U>arithmetic sequence</U>.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Such a sequence can be expressed as:</P>
<P>a<SUB>1</SUB>, a<SUB>1</SUB> + d, a<SUB>1</SUB> + 2d, a<SUB>1</SUB> + 3d, a<SUB>1</SUB> + 4d, ...</P>
<P>and the pattern makes it clear that a formula for the nth term is</P>
<P>a<SUB>n</SUB> = a<SUB>1</SUB> + (n - 1)d</P>
<P>By following the example of the consecutive integers, the sum of the first n terms is:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Figure/Eq3.8.4.GIF"><!----></P>
<P>Thus the sum is given by:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Figure/Eq3.8.2.GIF"><!----></P>
<P>Or, since a<SUB>n</SUB> = a<SUB>1</SUB> + (n - 1)d, this can be expressed as:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Figure/Eq3.8.3.GIF"><!----></P>
<P>It is now a simple matter to write a module to find the nth term, and the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence, without using any loops at all.</P>
