<P><B>Questions</B></P>

<P>1.  What is a complex number?</P>
<P>2.  "Complex numbers are not scalar numbers." Explain this statement.</P>
<P>3.  Why did the ISO committee decide to include complex numbers as a basic type?  What is so difficult about implementing them in a library?</P>
<P>4.  In what sense are CMPLX (on the one hand), and RE and IM (on the other) inverses of each other?</P>
<P>5.  Why are there two complex types and two associated libraries?</P>
<P>6.  What is the C-type and what kinds of entities are of this type?</P>
<P>7.  Suppose <I>zed</I> is of type COMPLEX.  What is wrong with the assignment <I>zed := 0</I>?</P>
<P>8.  The <I>norm</I> of a complex number is the number divided by its absolute value <I>abs(z)</I>.  Show that <I>abs(norm(z)) </I>is always equal to <i>one</i>.</P>
<P>9.  Write a small program to compute the value of <IMG SRC="Figure/figure17.4a.GIF"><!---->.</P>
<P>10. How may the risk of an overflow be reduced when computing the modulus or abs of a complex number? </P>
<P>11. What criticism was made against the design of <I>WholeStr</I> and <I>WholeConv</I> and why?</P>
<P>12. What other combinations of resistance and capacitance can be made to construct different types of RC circuits? Develop transfer functions for these.</P>
<P>13. Suppose there is also an inductance in the circuit, say on the bottom part of <a href="Ch17.4.html#figure 17.3">figure 17.3</a>.  What does the transfer function become?</P>
<P>14. How many different combinations of on each of resistance, capacitance, and inductance are there (one, two or three at a time).</P>
<P>15. Suppose two resisters are place in series. Write a program to compute the complex (AC) voltage drop across each from a 120 Volt AC source at 60Hz (cycles per second.</P>
<P>16. How does a library module allow a client program to handle its errors?</P>
<P>17. What is the difference between a <I>Decimal</I> type and a <I>BCD</I> type?</P>
<P>18. Add carefully thought out comments to the module <I>DecimalStr</I> in <a href="Ch17.5.html">section 17.5</a>.

<P><B>Problems</B></P>

<P>19. Re-implement <I>ComplexNumbersO</I> using an array implementation for the ADT.</P>
<P>20. Write and test your own procedures to compute the modulus and argument of a complex number.</P>
<P>21.  Write a program to solve quadratic equations of the form ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0.  The user should type in the coefficients a, b, and c and the program should compute the root(s), if any, using the quadratic formula x = (-b <U>+</U> d)/2 where d = sqrt(b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac).  Report answers that are complex numbers automatically in the form a + bi.</P>
<P>22. Modify the above program to allow for complex coefficients as well.</P>
<P>23. Write a program that will calculate the principal square root of a complex number and then display both square roots.</P>
<P>24. Write a program that will compute the principal n<sup>th</sup> root of the number one (unity) and then display all the n<sup>th</sup> roots.</P>
<P>25. Some people like to write complex numbers as ordered pairs (a, b).  Moreover, earlier in the text there was a module that implemented <I>points</I> as an ADT, and these are also normally written as ordered pairs. Write a module <I>PairIO</I> to read and write ordered pairs in the form (a, b).</P>
<P>26. Modify the module above to read and write any n-tuple (a, b, c, d, ...).</P>
<P>27. Re-do the Complex I/O in this chapter to employ low level scanners and converters as in Whole I/O.  Comment on the usefulness of this.</P>
<P>28. Complete the implementation of the module <I>Decimals</I>.</P>
<P>29. Implement the module <I>Polynomials</I>.</P>
<P>30. Implement the module <I>ComplexPolynomials</I>, which is the same as the module <I>Polynomials </I>except that the coefficients and the values of the variables (but not the exponents) may be complex.</P>
<P>31. Add the procedures <I>Divide</I> and <I>Derivative</I> to the module <I>Polynomials</I>.</P>
<P>32. Define and implement a module for date and time I/O.</P>
<P>33. Define and implement a module for date and time arithmetic.  You will need to be able to find out how many hours there are between two times, how many days between two dates, add a specified number of hours/minutes/seconds to a time, and so on. (You decide on exactly what needs to be included in the design.)</P>
<P>34. Write  your own version of the ISO module <I>RealConv</I>.</P>
<P>35. Write your own version of the ISO module <I>RealStr</I>. If the ISO module <I>LoReal</I> is available on your system, you may elect to use it or not as you wish.</P>
<P>36. Design and write a module to implement the ADT <I>Array</I> in a dynamic fashion. A client program should be able to create an array of specified size dynamically, and add or multiply two of these where the sizes permit.</P>
<P>37. Follow up the last question with a module to do I/O on these dynamic arrays.</P>
<P>38. Design and implement a module to do polynomial I/O.  You will have to decide what the format of a polynomial will be for such purposes.</P>
<P>39. Redesign the <i>ComplexIO</i> suite to input and output complex numbers in the form (r, <IMG SRC="../Ch6/Figure/theta.GIF" HEIGHT=9 WIDTH=10><!--q-->) (that is in polar coordinate form.)  You may wish to design the modules so that any pair of this form can be read/written, (lower level; can also be used with vectors) and the complex level just makes simple conversions from these into complex numbers.</P>
<P>40. Define a number type called a <I>Quat</I> by q = a + bi + cj + dk where i<sup>2</sup> = j<sup>2</sup> = k<sup>2</sup> = ijk = -1. Create a module defining and implementing this data type along with some basic operations.</P>
<P>41. Write the basic I/O module for the type <I>Quat</I>.</P>
