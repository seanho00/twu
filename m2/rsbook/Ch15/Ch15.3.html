<B><h2><a name="15.3.1">15.3.1</a> Heaps Defined</h2></B>
<P>The structure known as a heap is an interesting hybrid.  It is most easily conceptualized as a binary tree constructed according to some specific rules on the data being entreed.  However, each node of the tree is numbered consecutively, and it is possible to work with a heap by implementing it as an array.</P>

<blockquote><A NAME="Heap"></A>
	A <U>heap</U> is a sequence of data nodes n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>, n<sub>3,</sub> n<sub>4</sub>, ... n<sub>max</sub> in which n<sub>i</sub> <!--¾-->&lt;= n<sub>2i</sub> and n<sub>i</sub> <!--¾-->&lt;= n<sub>2i+1</sub> for all i with 1 <!--¾-->&lt;= i <!--¾-->&lt;= max/2.</blockquote>

<p>In a tree implementation, the n<sub>2i</sub> and n<sub>2i+1</sub> are the children of the node n<sub>i</sub>, (this makes the tree binary) so the rule in the definition can be expressed as:</p>

<blockquote><I>	In a heap every parent is greater than its child. </i></blockquote>

<P>A reverse heap (in which the rule is "less than the child" could also be constructed, but this will not be done here. In the heap shown below there are nine nodes.  The cardinal data at each node is placed inside the circle and each node is numbered outside the node to illustrate the structural relationships.</P>

<B><h2><a name="15.3.2">15.3.2</a> Heaps as Binary Trees</h2></B>
<P>In order to build a heap, data is placed in the tree as it arrives in the following manner:</P>

<pre>Add Heap Data =
  add a new node at the next leaf position
  use this new node as the current position
  While new data is less than that in the parent of the current node
     move the parent down to the current node
   make the parent (now vacant) the current node
  Place data in current node </pre>
<P>Thus, new nodes are always added on the deepest level in an orderly way, and the tree never becomes unbalanced.  There is no particular relationship among the data items in the nodes on any given level, even the ones that have the same parent, so certainly a heap is not a sorted structure.  It can however, be regarded as partially ordered. One should also note that a given set of data can be formed into many different heaps.  Which one results from the heapification will depend on the order in which the data arrives.</P>

<P><B>Example:</B> Data arrives to be heaped in the order 54, 87, 27, 67, 19, 31, 29, 18, 32, 56, 7, 12, 31</P>

<P>The series of diagrams illustrates what the heap looks like as each data item is added.</P>

<P>The next two insertions do not cause a rearrangement</P>
<P></P>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="Figure/Figure15.17.GIF" BORDER="1"></CENTER><!----></P>
<P></P>
<P>The following two both cause a rearrangement, and the one after that does not.</P>
<P></P>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="Figure/Figure15.18.GIF" BORDER="1"></CENTER><!----></P>

<P>If deletions of data are to be done, some work may be necessary to restore the tree to the properly filled state, because not all leaves are on the same level.  Only if the data in the highest numbered node is deleted will the operation be a simple inverse of insertion, for in that case the node can simply be removed without affecting anything else.  If data in some other node is deleted, there are two possible choices for what the algorithm could do:</P>

<P>- mark the node as unused and do the next insert there rather than by generating a new node</P>
<P>- shift data around in the tree so that all the nodes are occupied except the highest numbered one, and then delete that.</P>

<P>The first has the advantage of not requiring the tree to be rearranged, but the disadvantage of making insertion more complicated by requiring a list of unused nodes to be maintained.  The second has the advantage that insertion need not be changed, and the advantage of being more symmetric with insertion, but the disadvantage of producing a more complicated deletion algorithm:</P>

<pre>Delete and restructure=
  save data  from last node
  If node to delete data from is not last node
     insert data from last node starting in node where data is to be deleted
     reheapify working up or down as necessary from this point.
   delete last node</pre>

<P>If duplicate items are allowed, as in the example above, which one gets deleted depends on the order in which the tree is traversed to find the data. If the item <i>31</i> is deleted then any forward traversal to do so will find and delete the one on the bottom row. Other sets of rules are possible of course.  Adding an item could mean forbidding duplicates. Deleting could mean deleting all items with the given key.  Here is what the tree looks like after deleting the single item <i>31</i> followed by the item <i>67</i>.</P>

<P>Deleting item <i>19</i> puts the <i>56</i> temporarily on its spot and then sifts it down to trade with item <i>54</i>, producing:</P>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="Figure/Figure15.19.GIF" BORDER="1"></CENTER><!----></P>

<P>Deleting the item at the root (<i>7</i>) causes a substantial rearrangement as item <i>56</i> is placed in its spot and then sifted down the lesser of the child paths until it is a correct child again, producing:</P>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="Figure/Figure15.20.GIF" BORDER="1"></CENTER><!----></P>
<P></P>
<P>An attempt to delete something that is not there should not change the tree, but the programmer could require this to set some kind of error condition that could then be checked.</P>

<B><h2><a name="15.3.3">15.3.3</a> Defining the Heap </h2></B>
<P>With this description complete, the following can be offered as a definition for the Heap ADT.  Observe that it is somewhat more elaborate than the definition of the B-tree, as it allows for four kinds of traversals and in either direction.</P>
