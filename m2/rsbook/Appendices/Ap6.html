<B>PROCEDURE</B> Flush (file : File);
  (* The volume on which the file is located will be flushed.

<B>PROCEDURE</B> Close (file : File);

     After calling this procedure, if the close was successful, the memory is deallocated and variable is set to NIL; if it is not successful, the mode becomes invalid, and the variable is retained.

<B>TYPE</B>
  CoordSystem = (MacWin, bearing, standard); (* default = standard *)
(* The MacWin Coordinate system grows down and has the origin at the top
   left hand corner with angles measured clockwise. In the bearing
   system the home position (0,0) is the middle of the screen
   from which angles are measured clockwise. The standard system also
   starts in mid screen and grows up but measures from east as zero and
   thence counterclockwise. *)

  AngleType = (deg, rad, grad); (* Allows for angle type specification *)
  LabelType = <B>ARRAY</B> [0..50] <B>OF</B> <B>CHAR</B>;  (* Standard format for labels *)

<B>PROCEDURE</B> SetCoordSystem (kind : CoordSystem);
(* Allows the user to set the system. The default is the standard system so this has to be called only if a change is desired. This procedure concludes by calling Home. Any shift in the system origin must be made after calling this procedure.  *)
<B>PROCEDURE</B> SetAngleType (kind : AngleType);
(* Allows the user to set the angle measurement type. The default is degrees so this has to be called only if a change is desired. This procedure concludes by calling Home. Any shift in the system origin must be made after calling this procedure.  *)

<B>PROCEDURE</B> Home;
(* moves to 0,0 and then
     In the bearing system:
       - sets angle to 0 (North)
       - sets the rotational direction to clockwise
     In the MacWin & standard system:
       - sets the angle to 0 (East)
       - sets the rotational direction to clockwise (MacWin)
               or to counterclockwise (standard) *)

<B>PROCEDURE</B> ShiftOrigin (deltaX, deltaY : <B>INTEGER</B>);
(* Translate the origin by the amount specified.  The direction of the translation on the screen depends, of course, on the coordinate system being used. Drawing is now with respect to the new origin. Does not call home or change  any other settings. *)

<B>PROCEDURE</B> GetDimensions (<B>VAR</B> x, y: <B>INTEGER</B>);
  (* obtains the overall width and height of the drawing screen *)
<B>PROCEDURE</B> GetLocation (<B>VAR</B> x, y: <B>INTEGER</B>);
  (* get the drawing pen location in current coordinates *)

(* The following three procedures work in the current coordinate
system and on the stored pen position only but do no actual drawing. *)

<B>PROCEDURE</B> MoveBy (distance: <B>INTEGER</B>);
  (* move in the stored direction by the supplied distance *)
<B>PROCEDURE</B> MoveTo (x, y : <B>INTEGER</B>);
  (* move the drawing pen to the specified coordinates *)
<B>PROCEDURE</B> Move (dx, dy : <B>INTEGER</B>);
  (* move the drawing pen to a point (x + dx, y + dy) from the currently stored point *)

(* The following three procedures work in the current coordinate system on the stored pen direction only but do no actual drawing. 
The angle is assumed to be in the currently set units. *)

<B>PROCEDURE</B> GetCurrentAngle () : <B>REAL</B>;
  (* Return the current angle in the current units *)
<B>PROCEDURE</B> Turn (angle : <B>REAL</B>);
  (* change the stored pen direction by adding its angle to the one supplied *)
<B>PROCEDURE</B> TurnTo (angle : <B>REAL</B>);
(* change the stored pen direction by setting its angle to the one supplied *)

(* The following two procedures use the pen to draw a line and change the stored position. *)

<B>PROCEDURE</B> LineBy (distance: <B>INTEGER</B>);
  (* Draws in the stored pen direction the number of units supplied. *)
<B>PROCEDURE</B> LineTo (x, y : <B>INTEGER</B>);
(* Draws a line from the current stored position to the supplied one without using or changing the stored direction. *)
<B>PROCEDURE</B> Line (dx, dy : <B>INTEGER</B>);
(* Line to a point (x + dx, y + dy) from the current point without using or changing the stored direction. *)

(* The following two procedures place a dot on the screen, but do not change the pen direction. Measurement is in pixels; not scaled. *)

<B>PROCEDURE</B> Dot;
   (* places a dot at the present location *)
<B>PROCEDURE</B> DotAt (x, y : <B>INTEGER</B>);
   (* does a MoveTo, then a dot *)

(* These procedures are for annotating the graph paper with a scale and labels for the axes. *)

<B>PROCEDURE</B> SetLabels (horix, vert : LabelType);
   (* Sets the names for the horizontal and vertical axes. *)
<B>PROCEDURE</B> ShowLabels;
   (* Show the labels - if no label is set then "x" and "y" are used *)
<B>PROCEDURE</B> ShowAxes;
   (* Show the axes for the graph *)

(* The following procedures allow for a scaling of the graph paper and the plotting of points according to the scale. If the scale is 10, there is one unit every ten division marks. This will make the plotting of functions more readible. The default is one unit per division mark.
    EXAMPLE: setting the scale to 5 using cm's as the unit means 1 cm = 5 division marks.*)

<B>PROCEDURE</B> SetScale (dataPerDivision : <B>CARDINAL</B>);
   (* Set the scale by which the graph is measured *)
<B>PROCEDURE</B> PlotPoint( x, y : <B>REAL</B>);
   (* Plot a scaled point on the graph *)
<B>PROCEDURE</B> PolarPlotPoint (radius, angle : <B>REAL</B>);
   (* Moves to a given angle and radius and places a scaled dot at that point.
	 The angle is assumed to be in the currently set units. *)
