9.7 Declaring and Assigning to Records </B></H2>
<P>The discussions of <A HREF="../Ch1/Ch1.6.html#1.6.3">sections 1.6.3</A> and <A HREF="Ch9.1.html">9.1</A> explored the idea of modeling data that by its very nature consists of items of different types aggregated together into a single structure.  For instance, one might wish to define an aggregate, or record:</P>
<PRE>
traveller =
  name
  home address
  airline
  flight number
  arrival
  departure
  luggage</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><A NAME="Record">A</A> Modula-2 <U>record</U> is a data abstraction designed to allow for aggregates of various types of related data named by a single identifier.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Records are examples of what mathematicians call <I>cross products</I>.  A cross product of two sets is the set of ordered pairs with first coordinate from the first set, second from the second set, thus:</P>
<P>A <!--¥-->* B = { (a, b) | a <IMG SRC="Figure/in.GIF"><!--‘--> A and b <IMG SRC="Figure/in.GIF"><!--‘--> B}</P>
<P>For instance,</P>
<P>{2, 4} <!--¥-->* { 1, 6}  =  {(2, 1), (2, 6), (4, 1), (4, 6)}</P>
<P>In the case of records, the cross product is done with two or more (usually different) data types.  That is, one expresses a structure <I>struct</I> that is</P>
<P>REAL <!--¥-->* CARDINAL <!--¥-->* BOOLEAN</P>
<P>as, say</P>
<PRE>
<B>TYPE</B>
  struct = 
    <B>RECORD</B>
      salary : <B>REAL</B>;
      days : <B>CARDINAL</B>;
      male : <B>BOOLEAN</B>;
    <B>END</B>;</PRE>
<P>where both the overall kind of structure (type) and the individual parts have names.</P>
<P>Consider, for instance, the representation of a <I>person</I> as a record where the abstraction (the program data as opposed to the actual person) consists of a last name, first name, birthdate, sex, identity number, marital status, and a statement about their role on a university campus.  Of these, one could also in turn structure a record for <I>dates</I> that consists of a year, a month, and a day.  Here are some declarations to illustrate the Modula-2 syntax:</P>
<PRE>
<B>TYPE</B>
  MonthType = (Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sept, Oct, Nov, Dec);
  Name = <B>ARRAY</B> [0 .. 20] <B>OF</B> <B>CHAR</B>;
  Role = (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, professor, administrator, maintenance, associate, assistant, secretary);

  Date =
    <B>RECORD</B>
      year : <B>CARDINAL</B>;
      month : MonthType;
      day : [1 .. 31];   (* semicolon optional *)
    <B>END</B>;    (* of the record Date *)

  Person =
    <B>RECORD</B>
      lastname, firstname : Name;
      birth : Date;
      male : <B>BOOLEAN</B>;
      idnumber : <B>CARDINAL</B>;
      married : <B>BOOLEAN</B>;
      status : Role;
    <B>END</B>;  (* of the record Person *)

<B>VAR</B>
  student, faculty : Person;</PRE>
<P><B>NOTES</B>: 1. RECORD is a reserved word, and each RECORD declaration must have an associated END.</P>
<P>	 2. The individual parts of a record are called <I>fields</I>.</P>
<P>	 3. A record field can be of any type, including an array, a user-defined type, or another record.</P>
<P>	 4. In the original definition of Modula-2, a function procedure could not return a RECORD as its result.  Newer versions (including ISO standard ones) allow this.  If this restriction does exist, it will be noted later that there may be a way around it.</P>
<P>	 5. There will probably be some implementation dependent maximum record size, though this is not likely to impact on the programs of a beginner.</P>
<P>The individual fields in each record each have their own identifier, and each is referred to by a qualified identifier that includes the record name itself.  The following statements assign the fields of the above record:</P>
<PRE>
student.lastname := <!--"-->&quot;Hacker<!--"-->&quot;;
student.firstname := <!--"-->&quot;Nellie<!--"-->&quot;;
student.birth.year := 1965;
student.birth.month := Feb;
student.birth.day := 12;
student.male := <B>FALSE</B>;
student.idnumber := 46725;
student.married := <B>FALSE</B>;
student.status := freshman;</PRE>
<P>In a similar way, one could assign the fields of a record representing a faculty member, except that the last one could read, say:</P>
<PRE>
faculty.status := associate;</PRE>
<P>One could also define the structure of <I>name</I> and <I>birth</I> within the declaration of <I>person</I>, writing:</P>
<PRE>
<B>TYPE</B>
  Person =
    <B>RECORD</B>
      lastname, firstname : Name;
      birth =
        <B>RECORD</B>
          year : <B>CARDINAL</B>;
          month : MonthType;
          day : [1 .. 31];
        <B>END</B>;    (* of the sub-record Date *)
      male : <B>BOOLEAN</B>;
      idnumber : <B>CARDINAL</B>;
      married : <B>BOOLEAN</B>;
      status : Role;
    <B>END</B>;  (* of the record Person *)</PRE>
<P>However, it is better programming practice to employ separate type declarations for each structure, rather than bury structures without type names inside another one (anonymous types).  Once <I>Date</I> is properly declared as a type, it can be used in a variety of other declarations, rather than having to write out its structure every time.  Such natural abstractions should always be made explicit in the code.</P>
