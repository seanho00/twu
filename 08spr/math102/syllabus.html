<ol>

<li> Homeworks are due in-class by 14:35 each Tues.
<b>NO LATE HOMEWORKS</b> except for extenuating circumstances.
Homework turned in after the start of class up to 5pm on the due date 
(including coming to class late) will be penalized 10%; after that they will
receive a zero mark.
If you can't make it to class, have a friend hand it in
for you or make prior arrangements with the instructor.
If you wish to email your homework in, it must be time-stamped before the
time of the due date.

<li> If you turn in your homework on-time, you can expect
the TA to have it marked within a week.  If you turn in your homework late,
the TA can take as long as he/she needs: you forfeit the privilege of getting
prompt feedback.

<li> Note that only a few questions from each homework might be marked.
Study groups are encouraged, but the final draft that you hand in must be
your own work -- don't just copy another's work!
All work must be shown for full marks.

functions are not required.  Please have a separate calculator from your 
cell phone or PDA.
