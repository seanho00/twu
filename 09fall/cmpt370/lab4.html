	Lab4 (20 pts): Trackball and Textures</h1>

In this lab you will add to your OpenGL virtual world:<ul>
  <li> OpenGL lighting with Gouraud shading,
  <li> Texture maps, and
  <li> A trackball interface to navigate the virtual world
</ul>
You may use your work from previous labs as a starting point.

<ul>
<h2>Basic requirements</h2>

<li> Create a 3D virtual world in OpenGL that is lit and smooth-shaded:
create lights (more than just ambient), add material properties
to your objects, and specify vertex normals.

<li> Use texture maps appropriately to liven up your virtual world.

<li> Add a trackball mouse interface to rotate around the world:
from mouse (x,y) motion (hint: consider FLTK handle() or GLUT),
construct an axis-angle representation of the rotation,
and use glRotate().  (You do not need to build quaternions, because
glRotate() will do it for you.)

<li> Make your 3D virtual world appealing; have fun with it!
(That's a project requirement!)

<h2>Extra credit (up to 3 pts, only if basic requirements are met)</h2>

<li> For extra credit, allow the user to "toss" the rotation of an object: if
the user releases the mouse button while still moving the mouse, the object
continues to rotate on its own in the same direction.  (Consider FLTK timeouts.)

<li> Provide a way to stop the animation (perhaps by single-clicking the mouse).

<h2>Modelling Resources</h2>

<li> If you'd like to read in more complex models rather than generating your
own, a fairly basic library to read Alias Wavefront OBJ files is 
<a href="http://www.xmission.com/~nate/tutors.html">Nate Robins' GLM</a>.
You can get it from many places, e.g.,
<a href="http://svn.avimator.com/avimator/trunk/">Avimator's SVN</a>
(glm.cpp and glm.h).  Basic usage (see the header file):
<pre>#include "glm.h"
GLMmodel* myModel = glmReadOBJ("myfile.obj", 0);
glmDraw(myModel, GLM_NONE, 0);
</pre>

<li> Another format that is very simple to read in is AC3D's format:
description and sample source code are at 
<a href="http://inivis.com/resources.html">Inivis' AC3D site</a>.

<li> AC3D is also a very easy modelling program that you can use;
you can download a free 14-day trial (Win/Mac/Linux) from their website.

<li> <a href="http://www.rhino3d.com/">Rhino</a> is a more full-featured
professional modelling software suite that is used by many animation studios.
They have a evaluation version that only saves 25 times.

<li> <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> is a very powerful
modelling/animation/game-environment package that is also used by many
animation studios; it is completely free to download and use.  (It also
scripts in Python!)  But it is quite complex to learn.

<h2>Lab write-up</h2>

<li> Follow <a href="lab_template.html">the template lab write-up</a>
to document your program.  Name your write-up:
<br><tt>your_name_lab4_writeup.doc</tt> (or .txt, etc.)
<br>Put it in the same project directory as your code so that it will be
included in the tarball.

<h2>Electronic turn-in</h2>

<li> Put everything (C++ code, header files, executable, lab
write-up) into a tarball/ZIP and upload it to myCourses under "Lab4":
<br><tt>your_name_lab4.zip</tt>

</ul>
