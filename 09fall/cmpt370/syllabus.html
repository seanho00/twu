<tr><th><h2>Description</h2></th><td>
This course is designed to provide already experienced students with some of
the advanced tools that they need to take their places as competent
professional programmers.  In this offering of CMPT 370, the topics we will be
exploring include graphical user interfaces, parallel programming, and 3D
graphics.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Objective</h2></th><td>
By the end of the course students should be able to <ul>
<li> <b>understand</b> the concepts of event-driven programming for GUIs and
<b>demonstrate</b> this understanding by programming in FLTK,
<li> <b>understand</b> the concepts of parallel programming and
<b>demonstrate</b> this understanding by programming in OpenMP, and
<li> <b>understand</b> the concepts of 3D computer graphics and
<b>demonstrate</b> this understanding by programming in OpenGL.
</ul>

</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Prerequisites</h2></th><td>
The first-year CMPT sequence (145/141/143 and 160+165/167), plus
either CMPT 231 or CMPT 285, or second-year transfer status from another school
with the instructor's permission.

<tr><th><h2>Required Text</h2></th><td>
There is no required text.  All our readings will be online.

<tr><th><h2>Topics</h2></th><td>
This semester we will cover three major topics; the approximate number of weeks
spent on each topic is shown in parentheses:<ul>
  <li> Graphical User Interfaces and Event Programming (2)
  <li> Parallel Programming (2)
  <li> Computer Graphics (6)
</ul></td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Labs</h2></th><td>
    As this course is programming-heavy, there is a strong emphasis on the
    programming labs, in which the student will design and implement a
    significant software program for each assignment.  Proficiency in C++
    is expected.  The tentative topics for each programming lab are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li> Lab 0: FLTK orientation tutorial
      <li> Lab 1: FLTK application, GUI design
      <li> Lab 2: OpenMP parallel program on Carmel
      <li> Lab 3: Animated 3D model in OpenGL
      <li> Lab 4: Texture maps and trackball rotation
      <li> Lab 5: Vertex and fragment shaders in GLSL
    </ul>
</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Marking</h2></th><td>
Letter grade assignment follows the TWU percentage to grade equivalents 
except that &gt;=85% and &lt;95% is an A; 95% and above is an A+.

<tr><th><h2>Notes</h2></th><td>
<ol>

  <li> Since this is a directed study, regular face-to-face meetings will
  only be needed approximately once every two weeks.  The student is expected
  to be in regular email contact at least once a week to update on progress.
  The lecture material will be posted online, and the student is expected to
  learn independently through the lecture notes, the additional reading
  resources, the programming assignments, and email/office hours as needed.
  The student will schedule with the instructor appointments to take the
  two midterms and the final exam.

<li> <b>All labs must be completed</b> -- if you do not turn in 
something for each lab, you will automatically fail the course.

<li> The good news is
the <b>late policy</b> is fairly lenient: penalty of 5% per calendar day, 
up to a week late.  More than a week late is
50% penalty.  More than two weeks late and it will not be accepted unless there
are extenuating circumstances.  We will use the timestamp on myCourses.  It is
your responsibility to make sure all parts of your lab are 
uploaded to the right place in myCourses by the deadline.

<li> During <b>exams</b>, all of the following are not permitted 
and should be left in your closed/zipped bag and put on the floor:<ul>
  <li> Textbooks, notes, cell phones (turn off), laptops, PDAs, 
  <i>electronic dictionaries</i>, calculators.
</ul>
Scratch paper will be provided.
Your desk should be clear except for your pencil/pen.

<li> <b>Academic integrity</b> is a core value of the entire TWU community.
This includes, but is not limited to, avoiding all forms of plagiarism and 
cheating.  Plagiarism is using someone else's work without attribution.
In this course, if you do it once you will get a zero, if you do it again you 
will automatically fail the course.  Any such cases also go into the 
University's files for future reference; TWU has a strict policy concerning
plagiarism.

A tutorial describing plagiarism and how to avoid it has been
prepared by TWU Librarian William Badke:
