<li> What is a <b>pseudo-random number generator</b>?  What is the role of
the <b>seed</b>?  Describe a situation in which a pseudo-random number
generator might even be more useful than a "true" random number generator.

<br><i>
A pseudo-random number generator is a deterministic function that takes
a seed value as input, performs some mathematical operation on it, and
produces a value within the desired range as output.  Usually, the desired
range is floating-point between 0 and 1.  The next time the PRNG is called,
it uses the last output value as input.  The intent is that the mathematical
operations are sufficiently complex that it is difficult to predict what the
next value in the sequence will be.  However, if one restarts the sequence
with the same seed, the same sequence of "random" numbers will be generated.
This can be useful, for instance, if one wants to guarantee that a card game
shuffles its deck the same way.

<li> Write a complete Python program that reads the 100th-120th bytes
of the file "data.txt", and prints those bytes to the screen.
Docstring and comments are not necessary, but you may receive partial
credit for pseudocode if the code is not perfect.
