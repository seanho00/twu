# c09ex15.py
#    Puzzle problem. Imagine a cube circumscribed about a unit sphere.
#    An "eyeball" at the origin "see" each wall as 1/6 of the field of
#    view. Suppose the eye is moved to (0.5, 0, 0), what proportion of
#    the total field of view is taken up by the side of the cube at x = 1.

# This program approximates the solution to this problem using Monte Carlo
# techniques. It generates rays in random directions from the point of
# observation and determines the proportion that intersect the side of cube
# at x = 1.

# if x is the x position of the observer and (a,b,c) are the components of a
#   direction vector, the points along the ray from the observer in that
#   direction are given by the parametric equation: p = (x,0,0) + t(a,b,c) for
#   t >= 0. Solving for the time of intersection (when p.x == 1) we have get
#   t == (1-x)/ a. Thus the point of intersection is (1, (1-x)b/a, (1-x)c/a)
#   So the ray "strikes" the side of interest iff:
#    (-1 <= (1-x)b/a <=1) and (-1 <= (1-x)c/a <= 1)
