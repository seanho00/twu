<h2>Lab 8: Lists and File I/O <em>(due Wed/Thu 4/5 Nov)</em></h2>

For this lab, you will be building complex data structures like Python
lists and also using file I/O to read/save results to file.
Choose one of the following options:<ul>

<li> <b><a href="m2/Ch7/Ch7.14.html">M2 &sect;7.14 #22</a></b>:
Your program should read in the list of words from a file specified
by the user (this can also help a lot for debugging!).

<li> <b><a href="m2/Ch7/Ch7.14.html">M2 &sect;7.14 #43</a></b>:
Also write a testbed program that can encrypt/decrypt a whole
(text) file, outputting to a new file.

<li> <b><a href="m2/Ch9/Ch9.14.html">M2 &sect;9.14 #39</a></b>:
You can use a Python list instead of a "record".
Read the student data in from a user-specified file rather than
getting it interactively from the user.

<li> <b><a href="m2/Ch9/Ch9.14.html">M2 &sect;9.14 #40</a></b>:
Note that your program needs not only to read previous balance
from file, but also to write the new transaction and new balance
to the end of the file -- the file should be a log of all transactions.

</ul>

<h2>Lab 5: Exceptions <em>(due Wed/Thu 25/26 Nov)</em></h2>

Write a library that provides <em>robust user input</em>:<br>
For each basic Python data type (int, float, bool, str), provide a function 
that reads input from
the keyboard and returns the value in the proper type.
E.g., <tt>input_str(), input_bool()</tt>, etc.
<ul>
<li>If the user types an invalid input (e.g., a string when an
  integer is expected), then an error message is printed, and 
  the function keeps prompting the user until
  the user does enter a valid input.
<li>Make sure to handle if the user just presses "Enter" without any input.
<li>Also provide a way for the user to cancel, and explain this to the user.
<li>Each function should be able to take
  either zero or one parameters; the parameter, if present, should be the
  prompt string (just like with regular <tt>input()</tt>).
<li>Each function should return a value of the proper type, or
  <tt>None</tt> if the user cancelled.  
<li>For <tt>input_bool()</tt>, allow the user to type any of
  <tt>(1, T, t, True, true, TRUE, Y, y, Yes, yes, YES)</tt> etc. for True,
  and any of <tt>(0, F, f, False, false, FALSE, N, n, No, no, NO)</tt> etc. for
  False.
</ul>
You may find your library useful for future projects!
