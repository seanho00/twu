<tr><th><h2>Description</h2></th><td>
A second step for students learning programming by showing them how
object-oriented concepts are employed in the design and writing of code in a
variety of notations.   The emphasis is on the theory of OO programming and
design of solutions, as well as implementation in a current OO language
such as Java or C++.

Students will be introduced to the general
concepts of object oriented programming and will learn one object oriented
language in sufficient detail to be able to produce substantial programs.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Prerequisites</h2></th><td>
CMPT 140 (145 preferred) or an equivalent course or working experience using a
procedural language such as Pascal, Modula-2, Oberon, Python, C, or C++.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Text</h2></th><td>
<b>Required:</b>
<em>Absolute Java</em>, Savitch, 3rd edition, Pearson Addison-Wesley, 2008.
ISBN 0-321-48792-3.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Topics</h2></th><td>
We will be using Sun's Eclipse development environment, using
the J2SE 6.0 platform (Java 1.6.0).  This is installed on the computer lab PCs.
You are free to use your own computer, as long as you set your compiler to
produce bytecode compatible with version 1.6 so that your code can be run
on the lab PCs.  No official support will be
provided for installing/compiling on your own computers.

<tr><th><h2>Marking</h2></th><td>
Letter grade assignment follows the TWU percentage to grade equivalents 
except that &gt;=85% and &lt;95% is an A; 95% and above is an A+.

<tr><th><h2>Notes</h2></th><td>
<ol>

  <li> Since this is a directed study, regular face-to-face meetings will
  only be needed approximately once every two weeks.  The student is expected
  to be in regular email contact at least once a week to update on progress.
  The lecture material will be posted online, and the student is expected to
  learn independently through the lecture notes, the additional reading
  resources, the programming assignments, and email/office hours as needed.
  The student will schedule with the instructor appointments to take the
  midterm and the final exam.

<li><b>Every</b> lab must be done; no exceptions!  If you do not turn in 
something for each lab, you will automatically fail the course.
But the late policy is fairly lenient: penalty of 5% per calendar day, up to a
week late.  More than a week late is
50% penalty.  More than two weeks late and it will not be accepted unless there
are extenuating circumstances.  We will use the timestamp on myCourses.  It is
your responsibility to make sure all parts of your lab are 
uploaded to the right place in myCourses by the deadline.

<li> During exams, all of the following are not permitted 
and should be left in your closed/zipped bag and put on the floor:<ul>
  <li> Textbooks, notes, cell phones, laptops, PDAs, iPods,
  <i>electronic dictionaries</i>, calculators.
</ul>

<li> During exams, your desk should be clear except for your pencil/pen.

<li>In case of inclement weather, call (604) 513-2147 or 
see <a href="http://www.twu.ca/conditions/">www.twu.ca/conditions</a>.
for official campus conditions.

<li> <b>Academic integrity</b> is a core value of the entire TWU community.
This includes, but is not limited to, avoiding all forms of plagiarism and 
cheating.  Plagiarism is using someone else's work without attribution.
In this course, if you do it once you will get a zero, if you do it again you 
will automatically fail the course.  Any such cases also go into the 
University's files for future reference; TWU has a strict policy concerning
plagiarism.

A tutorial describing plagiarism and how to avoid it has been
prepared by TWU Librarian William Badke:
