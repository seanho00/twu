Are teen smokers predominantly male?  To probe this question, a sample of 200
teenagers who regularly smoke was gathered, and the ratio of male to female
examined.
* What is the population in question? (1)
[teen smokers]
* What variable(s) are being measured?  What level of measurement are the
variables? (2)
[gender, categorical]
* Phrase the null and alternative hypotheses, both in words and in symbols.
What is the appropriate statistical test to conduct? (4)
[ H0: not predominantly male, P(M) <= 1/2.
  HA: predominantly male, P(M) > 1/2.  Chi-squared. ]
* Is the test 1-tailed, or 2-tailed, or omnibus ("all directions", 
an extension of 2-tailed)? Why? (1)
[ 1-tailed; the research question asks if there are more males than females,
a directional question. ]
* The data are that 113 of the teenagers were male; 87 were female.
Calculate the test statistic and bracket the p-value. (6)
[ chi-squared = (113-100)^2/100 + (87-100)^2/100 = 3.38, 
2-tailed: 0.05 < p < 0.10 (p=0.0659), so 1-tailed: 0.025 < p < 0.05 
(exact p=0.033).
* State your conclusion and interpret it in the context of the original
research question. (2)
[ Reject H0: Yes, teen smokers are predominantly male. ]

Are hospital emergency rooms in BC busier than those in Ontario?
The average number of ER visits per day was measured for a small number of
hospitals from both provinces.
* What is the population in question? (1)
[ hospitals in Canada ]
* What is the predictor (IV: independent variable) in this study?
What is the outcome (DV: dependent variable)?
What are their levels of measurement? (3)
[ IV: province (categorical).  DV: average number of ER visits per day
(continuous). ]
* Phrase the null and alternative hypotheses, both in words and in symbols.
What is the appropriate statistical test to conduct? (4)
[ H0: ERs in BC are no busier than in ON, mu_BC <= mu_ON.
  HA: ERs in BC are busier than in ON, mu_BC > mu_ON.
  t-test on two independent groups. ]
* The data: we examined five hospitals from BC, with daily ER visits of
  189, 194, 142, 183, 137.  The data for ON: 260, 126, 135, 71, 141, 71.
  (These are actual data I collected, albeit from a biased sampling!)
  Use an appropriate parametric test and bracket a p-value. (6)
[ 1-tailed p=0.16 ]
* State your conclusion and interpret it in the context of the original
research question. (2)
[ Fail to reject H0: insufficient evidence to show BC ERs are busier. ]
* Now try an appropriate non-parametric test and bracket a p-value. (4)
[ WMW: K_BC=25, K_ON=5, n=6,5, 1-tailed: .025 < p < .05 ]
* State your conclusion and interpret it in the context of the original
research question. (2)
[ Reject H0: BC ERs are busier ]
* In your opinion, which test is more applicable to this data?  Why?
Do the data meet the assumptions of parametricity? (3)
[ WMW is better; the data do not look normal -- small sample size and
strong outlier in ON (260). [ that's Scarborough Hospital in east Toronto,
with over 95,000 ER visits per year ] ]

Do prospective surgery patients feel less anxious after a doctor has 
explained the surgery procedure to them?  Nine patients were asked 
how anxious they felt both before and after the doctor's explanation; 
they used a 5-point scale with 1="not anxious at all" to 5="very anxious"
(this is a "Likert" scale).
* What is the population in question? (1)
[ prospective surgery patients ]
* What is the predictor (IV: independent variable) in this study?
What is the outcome (DV: dependent variable)?
What are their levels of measurement? (3)
[ IV: time (pre/post) (categorical). DV: anxiety level (ordinal). ]
* Phrase the null and alternative hypotheses, both in words and in symbols.
What is the appropriate statistical test to conduct? (4)
[ H0: anxiety level does not decrease (mu_d >= 0, using post-pre).
  HA: anxiety level decreases (mu_d < 0).
  Paired-samples t-test. ]
* Data: pre : 3 3 4 2 5 3 5 4
	post: 1 2 2 2 4 4 3 1
  (This is made-up data.)
  Use an appropriate parametric test and bracket a p-value. (6)
[ p = 0.01 ]
* State your conclusion and interpret it in the context of the original
research question. (2)
[ Reject H0: anxiety level does decrease after talking with doctor. ]
* Now try an appropriate non-parametric test and bracket a p-value. (4)
[ Sign: N- = 6, N+ = 1, B_s = 6, n_d = 7
  1-tail: .05 < p < .10 ]
* State your conclusion and interpret it in the context of the original
research question. (2)
[ Fail to reject H0: insufficient evidence to show anxiety level decreases ]
* In your opinion, which test is more applicable to this data?  Why?
Do the data meet the assumptions of parametricity? (3)
[ t-test is better.
Here the assumption of normality is on the pairwise differences;
we don't see any obvious problems, although the sample size is small.
Paired-sample t-test is probably more sensitive than sign test here, due
to some pairs having a strong decrease in anxiety level. ]

A research article reports that it has estimated the average BMI
(body mass index) of Canadian women to be 24.8 +/- 1.2 (units are kg/m^2),
with 95% confidence.  Their sample size was 25,000.
On the basis of their data and assumptions, mark each of the 
following statements as either true or false: (6)
* 95% of the 25,000 women in their study have BMI within the interval. [F]
* A random Canadian woman has a 95% chance of having BMI within the 
interval.  [F]
* A reasonable 99% confidence interval is 24.8 +/- 0.57. [F]
* If they had used a sample size of 100,000 instead of 25,000, their
95% confidence interval could have been half as wide. [T]
* The average BMI of Canadian women cannot possibly be exactly 
27.0 kg/m^2. [F]
* There is a 5% chance that the average BMI of Canadian women is
less than 23.6 or more than 26.0. [T]
