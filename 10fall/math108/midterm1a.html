either <b>(D)escriptive</b> or <b>(I)nferential</b>: <u>[4]</u>

  <li> 19.2% of BC residents in 2004 were clinically obese. <i>[(I)nferential]</i>
  <li> Of the children and adolescents studied in the 2004 Canadian Community
  Health Survey, 8% were clinically obese. <i>[(D)escriptive]</i>

<li> Say that in a certain town 63% of the people vote Conservative, 
and the probability that a townsperson drives a large truck is 3/7.
If you pick a random townsperson, there is a 27% chance that the townsperson
is a Conservative driving a large truck. <ol class="subparts">

  <li> What fraction of Conservatives in this town drive large trucks?
  <u>[3]</u>
  <i><br>Let C = Conservative, T = drives a large truck.<br>
    P(T|C) = P(T and C) / P(C) = .27 / .63 = 3/7 &asymp; 42.85%.</i>
  <div class="answerbox" style="height:3em"></div>

  <li> In this town, is voting Conservative <b>independent</b> of driving a 
  large truck?  Why or why not? Interpret what this means in the context
  of the townspeople.<u>[3]</u>
  <i><br> P(T|C) = 3/7 = P(T), so the two events are independent.
    <p>
    In words, if we narrow our focus to Conservatives, we see that 3/7 of
    Conservatives drive large trucks.  So we see that it doesn't matter whether
    a townsperson is Conservative or not, the chance of driving a large truck
    is still the same.

The diagram below is a <b>normal probability plot</b> for an 
artificially-generated dataset.
(Note that the n-scores are along the horizontal axis, and the y-scores
from the data are along the vertical axis; this matches the textbook.)
How does the distribution differ from a normal distribution?  Sketch the
distribution, highlighting where and how it deviates from the normal.

The list below shows the total serum bilirubin level (mg/dL) in a newborn baby,
measured at various times over a one-month period.<br>

  <li> Construct a relative frequency <b>histogram</b>, classifying the data by
  bins of width 1 mg/dL.<u>[4]</u>

  <div class="answerbox" style="height:4em"></div>
  
  <li> Find a 95% <b>confidence interval</b> for the average total serum bilirubin
  level for this baby over the one-month period. <u>[4]</u>
  <i><br>[SE=0.3127, df=8, t=2.31, conf int = (3.48, 4.92)]</i>

  <i><br>[We are 95% confident that the average total serum bilirubin for
    this baby during this period lies somewhere between 3.48 and 4.92 mg/dL.]</i>
  <div class="answerbox" style="height:3em"></div>

  <li> We feel this confidence interval is still too broad.
  In order to estimate the average total serum bilirubin level
  to within &plusmn;0.4 mg/dL with 90% confidence, <b>how many</b> measurements
  would we need to average?  (Assume the underlying true bilirubin level
  does not change.) <u>[4]</u>
  <i><br>[z=1.65, n = 14.91, round up to 15 measurements.]</i>

  the distribution of our sample to be more <b>normal</b>?  Why or why not?
  <u>[2]</u>
  <i><br>[No, the distribution of the sample follows the distribution of
    the population, which does not change with sample size.]</i>

An assay (test) measuring blood lactate during exercise is imprecise, returning
values normally distributed around the true lactic acid concentration, with a 
standard deviation of 2 mmol/L.  Blood lactate values of over 20 mmol/L are
considered "high".<ol class="subparts">

  <li> What is the probability that this assay returns a result <b>within</b>
  &plusmn;2.5 mmol/L of the true value? <u>[2]</u>
  <i><br>[z = &plusmn;2.5/2 = &plusmn;1.25, area = 78.88%]</i>
  <div class="answerbox" style="height:2em"></div>

  <li> If the true concentration of blood lactate in a patient is 18.3 mmol/L
  (not "high"), what is the probability that the assay could still return a
  value that is considered "<b>high</b>"? <u>[2]</u>
  <i><br>[z = (20-18.3)/2 = 0.85, area to the right = 1 - 0.8023 = 19.77%]</i>

  <li> Since the assay is so imprecise, we run it <b>five</b> times and average the
  results.  Using the same true concentration of 18.3 mmol/L, what is the 
  probability that the average of five runs is still "high"? <u>[4]</u>
  <i><br>[SE = 2/sqrt(5) = 0.8944, z = (20-18.3)/0.8944 = 1.90,

A particular screening test for colon cancer
has a 11% false-positive rate (i.e., 89% <b>specificity</b>)
and a 7% false-negative rate (i.e., 93% <b>sensitivity</b>).
<ol class="subparts">

  <li> Suppose the test is applied to a group of patients, 40% of whom are
  known to have colon cancer.
  Draw an <b>event tree</b> for the outcomes of the test.  Label the tree
  with probabilities for each branch.  Also calculate the probabilities of each
  final outcome (leaf of the tree). <u>[5]</u>

  <li> What is the probability that a random patient from this group will
  <b>test positive</b> for colon cancer using this screening test?<u>[2]</u>
  <i><br>[37.2% + 6.6% = 43.8%]</i>

to quit within the first five years of working as a nurse.

  <i><br>[Gender and whether the nurse quits within the first five years.]</i>

  random sampling.  How would you measure the variables?  Would the
  measurement process bias your sampling? <u>[3]</u>
  <i><br>[Employment records from hospitals/clinics: find all nurses who
