<tr><th><h2>Description</h2></th><td>
This course is an introduction to applied statistics addressed, in particular, to students specializing in the field of nursing. The focus is on developing the conceptual aspects of the subject rather than the mathematical foundations and assumes no prerequisite except elementary algebra. Topics include descriptive statistics, probability, the normal, t-, chi-square and F-distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, correlation and regression, ANOVA. Applications are directed towards health and biological studies.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Objective</h2></th><td>
By the end of the course students should be able to <ul>
<li> understand the principles underlying statistical procedures
<li> use the most common statistical tools
<li> demonstrate the use of statistical reasoning in health and biological sciences
</ul>

</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Prerequisites</h2></th><td>
A minimum of C in  BC Math , Principles of Mathematics 11.
Note that credit cannot be obtained for both MATH102 and MATH108.

Students with a weak math background or who have not taken a math class
for a number of years will need to catch up on their own and
perhaps find a private tutor (see TWUSA).

<b>Note: this course is designed for Nursing students only!
  If you are not in the Nursing program, you will need to get permission from
  the instructor to enroll; priority must be given to nursing students, and
  the class is very full every year.</b>

<tr><th><h2>Notes</h2></th><td>
<ol>

<li> Homeworks are due by the <i>start</i> of class each Thursday.
<b>NO LATE HOMEWORKS</b> except for extenuating circumstances.
Homework turned in after the start of class up to 5pm on the due date 
(including coming to class late) will be penalized 10%; after that they will
not be accepted and will receive a zero mark.
If you are turning your homework late, it is your responsibility to ensure I
get it.
Late homeworks forfeit the expectation of prompt feedback -- the TA may take
as long as he/she needs to mark late homeworks.
If you cannot come to class to turn in your homework, have a friend hand it in
for you or make prior arrangements with the instructor.

<li> Note that only a few questions from each homework will actually be marked.
Study groups are encouraged, but the final draft that you hand in must be
your own work.  All work must be shown for full marks.

<li> A scientific calculator is required; graphing or special statistical 
functions are not required.  Please have a separate calculator from your 
cell phone or PDA, since these are not allowed during exams.  Sharing of
calculators during exams is not permitted.

<li> During in-class quizzes/exams, all of the following are not permitted 
and should be left in your closed/zipped bag and put on the floor:<ul>
  <li> Textbooks, notes, cell phones (turn off), laptops, PDAs, 
  <i>electronic dictionaries</i>
</ul>
Your desk should be clear except for your pencil/pen and calculator.

<li> Students who miss more than 25% of class sessions may be barred from taking
the final exam [2010-2011 Academic Calendar p.38].

<li>In case of inclement weather, the TWU campus conditions will be announced
on local radio stations and posted on the TWU website at
<a href="http://www.twu.ca/conditions/">www.twu.ca/conditions</a>.

<li> <b>Academic integrity</b> is a core value of the entire TWU community.
This includes, but is not limited to, avoiding all forms of plagiarism and 
cheating.  Plagiarism is using someone else's work without attribution.
In this course, if you do it once you will get a zero, if you do it again you 
will automatically fail the course.  Any such cases also go into the 
University's files for future reference; TWU has a strict policy concerning
plagiarism.

A tutorial describing plagiarism and how to avoid it has been
prepared by TWU Librarian William Badke:
