  <li> A study with 60 participants results in the following data:
  <br>SS<sub>X</sub> = 1,350,000, SS<sub>Y</sub> = 9,000, SS<sub>XY</sub> = -70,000.
  <br>Find the <b>slope</b> of the best-fit line, indicate its <b>units</b>,
  and <b>interpret</b> the slope in light of the model for vitamin B12 and
  depression. (Keep at least 4 significant figures in the slope.) <u>[3]</u>
  <i><br>[ -0.05185 pts/(pg/mL): for every 1 pg/mL increase in vitamin B12 level,
    level of depressive symptoms decreases by 0.05185 points on BDI. ]</i>
  <div class="answerbox" style="height:6em"></div>

  <li> The <b>average</b> vitamin B12 level in the study was 500 pg/mL,
  and the average BDI score in the study was 45 points.
  Find the <b>equation</b> of the best-fit line, and interpret the
  <b>intercept</b> of the line in light of the model. <u>[3]</u>
  <i><br>[ BDI = -0.05185 (B12) + 70.93: when vitamin B12 levels are zero,
    BDI score should be 70.93 (which is impossible, max is 63). ]</i>
  <div class="answerbox" style="height:7em"></div>

  <li> Find the <b>correlation</b> between vitamin B12 level and depressive
  level in this study. <u>[2]</u>
  <i><br> r = SS<sub>XY</sub> / sqrt(SS<sub>X</sub> SS<sub>Y</sub>) = -0.635.</i>

  <li> What <b>fraction</b> of the variability in depressive levels in this
  study is explained by the linear relationship with vitamin B12 levels? <u>[2]</u>

  <li> Describe the <b>distribution</b> of BDI depressive levels predicted
  by the linear model when vitamin B12 levels are at 600 pg/mL. <u>[4]</u>
  <i><br>[ Normally distributed, mean = ....
    <br>SS<sub>resid</sub> = (1 - 0.4033)(9000) = 5370.37, so

  <li> Answer the original research question: bracket a p-value, state your
  conclusion, and interpret it in light of the original research question. <u>[4]</u>
  <i><br>[ so SE = s<sub>Y|X</sub> / SS<sub>X</sub>  = ....,
    so t = slope/SE = .... ] </i>
