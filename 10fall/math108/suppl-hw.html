<h1><a href="http://twu.seanho.com/10fall/math108/">
		MATH 108 Fall 2010</a> Supplemental HW</h1>

The following are additional questions which are part of the
respective homework sets.

<h2><a name="HW2">HW2</a></h2><ol>

  <li> Classify each of the following statements (which may or may not be true)
  as either (D)escriptive or (I)nferential:<ol class="subparts">
    <li> 20% of plastic bottled water in Canada contains measurable amounts of
    bisphenol A.
    <li> Out of 30 plastic water bottles we measured, 6 bottles contained
    measurable amounts of bisphenol A.
    <li> 33.9% of adults in the U.S. are clinically obese.
    <li> The mean age at diagnosis of self-reported diabetes in Canada is
    46.823 years.
    <li> In a 1991 LCDC General Social Survey of 472 Canadians, 68% of 
    diabetics were diagnosed after age 40.
  </ol>

  <li> Suppose you wish to study whether people in rural communities in Canada
  utilize family doctors (e.g., visits per year) more than people in urban
  communities.
  <ol class="subparts">
    <li> What is the population in question?
    <li> List the variables which need to be measured.
    <li> For each variable, indicate its level of measurement and whether
    it is a predictor (independent variable) or outcome (dependent variable).
    <li> State the research question precisely in words and in notation as
    we discussed in class.
    <li> Discuss how you might do the sampling process.  What are some steps
    you could take to ensure a random sampling?  Address both criteria for
    random sampling.  Ch8 of the textbook has further reading if you want
    more ideas.
  </ol>

  <li> Suppose you wish to study whether praying more (e.g., minutes per day)
  reduces white blood cell count (cells per microlitre) in patients with leukaemia.
  <ol class="subparts">
    <li> What is the population in question?
    <li> List the variables which need to be measured.
    <li> For each variable, indicate its level of measurement and whether
    it is a predictor (independent variable) or outcome (dependent variable).
  </ol>

  <li> Suppose that in a study 70% of the participants are married and
  40% of the participants consider their jobs to be high-stress.
  Consider the probability that a participant in the study is married
  and also has a high-stress job.
  <ol class="subparts">
    <li> What is the minimum possible value for this probability?
    Draw a Venn diagram illustrating this situation.
    <li> What is the maximum possible value for this probability?
    Draw a Venn diagram illustrating this situation.
  </ol>

</ol>

<h2><a name="HW3">HW3</a></h2><ol>
  <li> Let the sample space S represent people born in Canada.
  Let the event A represent people born in Alberta and B represent people born
  in BC.  Are the events A and B <b>independent</b>, in the statistical sense?

  <li> In a study of Canadian nurses, say that 60% of the nurses are in urban
  hospitals, and that one quarter of the nurses use prescription
  anti-depressants on themselves.  Out of all the nurses in the study,
  20% are in hospitals and also on anti-depressants.<ol class="subparts">
    <li> For <b>each</b> of the three probabilities given (60%, 25%, 20%),
    express the probability in <b>notation</b> (e.g., P(A)) and draw a
    <b>Venn diagram</b>, shading in the relevant region
    (draw three separate Venn diagrams).
    <li> In this study, what is the chance that an urban-hospital nurse
    is on anti-depressants?
    <li> In this study, is being in an urban hospital <b>independent</b>
    of being on anti-depressants?  Why or why not?
  </ol>

  <li> Come up with your own example (not one we have learned so far)
  of two events which are independent.
  Be sure to specify what the entire sample space is.
</ol>
