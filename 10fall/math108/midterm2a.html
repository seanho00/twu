The average amount of exercise (hours per week) was measured for a number of
urban dwellers and rural dwellers.
A 95% confidence interval for the difference of means (urban - rural)
is (-0.27, 1.23).  Based on this information, indicate whether each of the
following statements is "True" or "False".  For clarity, please write the 
entire word, "True" or "False", rather than simply "T" or "F". <u>[6]</u>
<ol class="subparts">
  <li> Urban dwellers exercise an average of between 0.27 hrs less
  and 1.23 hrs more per week than rural dwellers.

  per week than rural dwellers.
  <li> We are 95% certain that urban dwellers exercise between 0.27 hrs less

  <li> With 95% confidence, the difference in hrs/week of exercise between

In a study of BC nurses, an analysis was run to determine whether
which nursing school the nurse graduated from had an impact on salary.
