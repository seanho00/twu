<li> Say that in a certain town 60% of the people vote Conservative, 
and the probability that a townsperson drives a large truck is 4/7.
If you pick a random townsperson, there is a 27% chance that the townsperson
is a Conservative driving a large truck. <ol class="subparts">

  <li> What fraction of Conservatives in this town drive large trucks?
  <u>[3]</u>
  <i><br>Let C = Conservative, T = drives a large truck.<br>
    P(T|C) = P(T and C) / P(C) = .27 / .60 = 45%</i>
  <div class="answerbox" style="height:3em"></div>

  <li> In this town, is voting Conservative <b>independent</b> of driving a 
  large truck?  Why or why not? Interpret what this means in the context
  of the townspeople.<u>[3]</u>
  <i><br> P(T|C) = 45%, but P(T) = 4/7 &asymp; 57%, so the two events are 
    not independent.
    <p>
    In this town, the Conservatives are less likely to drive large trucks
    than the non-Conservatives (perhaps contrary to stereotypes!).

The list below shows the total serum bilirubin level (mg/dL) in a newborn baby,
measured at various times over a one-month period.<br>

  <li> Find a 95% <b>confidence interval</b> for the average total serum bilirubin
  level for this baby over the one-month period. <u>[4]</u>
  <i><br>[SE=0.3986, df=8, t=2.31, conf int = (3.381, 5.219)]</i>

    this baby during this period lies somewhere between 3.38 and 5.22 mg/dL.]</i>
  <div class="answerbox" style="height:3em"></div>

  <li> We feel this confidence interval is still too broad.
  In order to estimate the average total serum bilirubin level
  to within &plusmn;0.4 mg/dL with 90% confidence, <b>how many</b> measurements
  would we need to average?  (Assume the underlying true bilirubin level
  does not change.) <u>[4]</u>

  <li> If we increase the sample size to n=40 measurements, would we expect
  the distribution of our sample to be more <b>normal</b>?  Why or why not?
  <u>[2]</u>
  <i><br>[No, the distribution of the sample follows the distribution of
    the population, which does not change with sample size.]</i>

An assay (test) measuring blood lactate during exercise is imprecise, returning
values normally distributed around the true lactic acid concentration, with a 
standard deviation of 3 mmol/L.  Blood lactate values of over 20 mmol/L are
considered "high".<ol class="subparts">

  <li> What is the probability that this assay returns a result <b>within</b>
  &plusmn;2.7 mmol/L of the true value? <u>[2]</u>
  <i><br>[z = &plusmn;2.7/3 = &plusmn;0.9, area = 63.18%]</i>
  <div class="answerbox" style="height:2em"></div>

  <li> If the true concentration of blood lactate in a patient is 18.2 mmol/L
  (not "high"), what is the probability that the assay could still return a
  value that is considered "<b>high</b>"? <u>[2]</u>
  <i><br>[z = (20-18.2)/3 = 0.60, area to the right = 1 - 0.7257 = 27.43%]</i>
  <div class="answerbox" style="height:2em"></div>

  <li> Since the assay is so imprecise, we run it <b>five</b> times and average the
  results.  Using the same true concentration of 18.2 mmol/L, what is the 
  probability that the average of five runs is still "high"? <u>[4]</u>
  <i><br>[SE = 3/sqrt(5) = 1.34, z = (20-18.2)/1.34 = 1.34

A particular screening test for colon cancer
has a 17% false-positive rate (i.e., 83% <b>specificity</b>)
and a 5% false-negative rate (i.e., 95% <b>sensitivity</b>).
<ol class="subparts">

  <li> Suppose the test is applied to a group of patients, 40% of whom are
  known to have colon cancer.
  Draw an <b>event tree</b> for the outcomes of the test.  Label the tree
  with probabilities for each branch.  Also calculate the probabilities of each
  final outcome (leaf of the tree). <u>[5]</u>

  <b>test negative</b> for colon cancer using this screening test?<u>[2]</u>
  <i><br>[2% + 49.8% = 51.8%]</i>
  <div class="answerbox" style="height:2em"></div>

The diagram below is a <b>normal probability plot</b> for an 
artificially-generated dataset.

Suppose you wish to study whether male nurses are more likely than female nurses
to quit within the first five years of working as a nurse.

  <li> What is the <b>population</b> in question? <u>[1]</u>

  <li> Discuss how you might do the <b>sampling</b> process.  What are some
  steps you could take to ensure a random sampling?  Address both criteria for
  random sampling.  How would you measure the variables?  Would the
  measurement process bias your sampling? <u>[3]</u>
  <i><br>[Employment records from hospitals/clinics: find all nurses who
    quit within five years, and all nurses who have been working as nurses
