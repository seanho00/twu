Name the five steps to <b>top-down</b>
problem solving as described in the text.<br>
(It's okay if you can't remember the exact wording;
the concepts are more important.)
<br><b>Also:</b> describe each step in your own words,
and why it is important!
<u>[5]</u><ul>

Name the five program <b>control/flow</b> abstractions
we talked about in class.  For each one, name a Python
language construct which implements the abstraction.
(There is one abstraction which we are not covering in Python;
you may write "N/A" for the Python for that one.)
<u>[5]</u><ul>
<li><i>Sequence (newlines)</i><br>
<li><i>Selection (if, elif, else)</i><br>

</ul>

Write "yes" or "no" next to each of the following six strings to indicate
whether it can be used as a valid name for a user-defined Python variable.
If "no", indicate why.

Use the Python <tt>range()</tt> function to create the following list.
<br>(There are several possible correct answers.)
<br>(Don't worry about Py3's list/iterator issue; just use range().)

The following is meant to be an interactive gradebook that
converts from a percentage into a letter grade:
95 and above is A+, 85-95 is A, 80-85 is A-, and everything below is
fail (it's a really tough program!).
The program should prompt the user 100 times for grades.
Unfortunately, the program was written by a terrible coder (me!),
so there are numerous <b>bugs</b> in the code.
Find all the bugs and fix them. <u>[8]</u><br><br>
<pre>

For i : range(1 .. 100)

	grade == input('What\'s the grade percentage? ')

	if grade &gt; 95

		print("That's an A+!')

	if 85 &gt; grade &gt; 95:

		print("""An A is really good!""")

	elsif 80 &lt; grade:

		print( You got an A-! )

  <br>The apostrophe in "What's" is okay; triple-quotes are okay;

Describe and contrast the roles of the <b>producer</b> and the <b>director</b>
in a team.  Describe specific examples of what these roles might look like
for a particular kind of task, e.g., developing software, building a bridge,
making a movie, etc. <u>[6]</u><br>
<i>
  Producer is a managerial position -- keeping people on task and on schedule,
  making sure everyone knows what they're supposed to be doing, facilitating
  communication amongst team members.  Practical, realist, engineering-type.
  <br>Director has the vision and concept -- a technical director knows the
  design and code better than anyone else; an artistic director controls the
  look and feel of the movie; an architect designs the building.
</i>

<li class="break">
Compare and contrast <b>static</b> typing versus <b>dynamic</b> typing,
including pros/cons. <u>[4]</u>
<br><i>
  (The key here is <b>type</b>: not whether the values of the variables can
  change, but whether their <b>types</b> can change.)
  <br><b>Static typing</b>: variables cannot change type.
  Must declare type of variable and initialize value.
  Compiler enforces correct type.
  <br><b>Dynamic typing</b>: can change type.
  More flexible, but usually we don't want variables to change type.

<li>
Describe and contrast the <b>requirements</b> document and the
<b>design specification</b> for a software project. <u>[5]</u>
<br><i>
  Requirements are agreed upon by the client and the design team.
  They form a written, formal definition of what the client is asking for;
  they define what it means for the project to "succeed".
  Ideally, the client would not change the requirements once the software
  team has started work.<br>
  Design specifications are agreed upon by the design team and the
  implementation team.  They form a written, formal definition of the
  architecture of the software project -- its components, top-down design,
  etc.  It may contain pseudocode, diagrams, sketches, etc.

<b>Newton's method</b> for computing square roots is an iterative method
which starts from an initial guess of the square root and gets closer to
the true square root with each step, according to the following algorithm:
<blockquote>
  Let x be the number we wish to take the square root of.
  <br> Let r be our current guess for the value of the square root.
  <br> Calculate our next guess via (r + x/r)/2.
  <br> Repeat until the guesses don't change by more than, say, 0.0001 (our
  desired level of precision).
  <!-- too hard?  just iterate 100x ? -->
</blockquote>

Your task is to code a Python <b>function</b>, called <tt>newton(x)</tt>,
that uses Newton's method to calculate and return the square root of x.

<ol class="subparts">
  <li> Write a <b>docstring</b> for this function, including detailed
  pre-condition and post-condition. <u>[4]</u>

  <li> Write <b>Python code</b> implementing this function.
  Use x/2 as the initial guess for the square root.
  Obviously, you may not use math.sqrt for this!
  (It turns out that math.sqrt does use a similar algorithm -- Newton's method
  converges to the right answer quite quickly!) <u>[8]</u>
</ol>

<p>
Comments and pseudocode are not required but may earn you partial credit
if they show good design thinking.
Little credit will be given for uncommented incorrect code.
Note that your code is not required to print() anything on the screen
or to input() anything from the console.
