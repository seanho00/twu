Compare and contrast Python <b>lists</b> with C/M2 arrays <u>[4]</u>
<i><br>
  Python lists can change length (can insert/delete), can have items of
  differing type, can have items which change type (due to Python's
  dynamic typing), and have various operators/functions defined on them,
  such as del, len(), negative indexing, list slicing, etc.
</i>
<div class="answerblock" style="height:11em"></div>

<li>
Compare and contrast <b>static</b> typing versus <b>dynamic</b> typing.
What are pros/cons of each?
<u>[4]</u><br>
<i>
  (The key here is <b>type</b>: not whether the values of the variables can
  change, but whether their <b>types</b> can change.)
  Static typing: variables cannot change type
  Must declare type of variable and initialize value
  Compiler enforces correct type
  Dynamic typing: can change type
  More flexible, but usually we don't want variables to change type

What is <b>wrong</b> with the following block of Python code?

<li> What is a <b>stub function</b>, and why might such things be useful
in software development?  Describe an example.<u>[5]</u>
<i><br>
  In top-down design of a complex software system, it is helpful to build
  the general framework first, and fill in the details later.  An analogy
  is building the frame of a house first, then filling in the wiring,
  plumbing, drywall, and appliances later.  A stub function is a placeholder
  for a complete function; it does not perform the computations yet but
  always returns a dummy value, e.g., 0.  An example is our ROT13 program,
  when we had the framework of converting between letters and ASCII codes,
  but did not actually do the ROT13 encryption arithmetic.
</i>
<div class="answerblock" style="height:11em"></div>

<li> Consider the concepts of <b>call-by-value</b> and <b>call-by-reference</b>.
<ol class="subparts">
  <li> Define and contrast these two terms as general <b>concepts</b>
  (i.e., independent of Python). <u>[4]</u>
  <i>In call-by-value, the value in the actual parameter is copied to the 
    formal parameter; the two are separate (so changes to the formal parameter
    will not affect the actual parameter).
    <br>In call-by-reference, the formal parameter is a reference (alias)
    to the actual parameter, so changes in one show up in the other.</i>
  <div class="answerblock" style="height:8em"></div>
  <li> Write <b>Python</b> code which clearly demonstrates the difference 
  between the two. <u>[4]</u>
  <i><pre>
  	def doubler(x):
		x *= 2
	a = 7
	doubler(a)
	b = [ 3, 4, 5 ]
	doubler(b)
</pre>
  The first call to doubler() passes an int, so (in Python) it is passed by value.
  The function has no effect and does not return anything.
  <br>The second call to doubler() passes a list, so (in Python) it is passed by
  reference.  The function modifies the list in-place; it still does not return
  anything, but afterward the variable 'b' has the value '[3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5]'.</i>

Waterfall (WADES) assumes perfect requirements, perfect specification,
perfect design, etc.  In reality, we never get that, and have to move
on with imperfect documentation, often resulting in a poor product and
an unhappy client.  The "V" model is a slight modification of WADES that
emphasizes testing of each stage (components, systems, releases, products)
before completion.  The spiral/agile model emphasizes repeated cycles of the
waterfall model, early prototypes to get client feedback, and flexibility
to changes in requirements, specification, or design.

<li> Write a Python program which prints (on the screen) every word which
appears exactly <b>once</b> (and no more than once) in the file "input.txt".
<br><br>Ignore case.  Words are separated by spaces or newlines, and all 
punctuation, digits, etc.  can be treated the same as letters.
For instance, if the file "input.txt" contains:
<pre>	Hello, this is a text file.  hello, here's a TEXT file.</pre>
then your program should output "<tt>this here's is</tt>".
<br>(Order of the words in the output does not matter.)
<br><br>Ensure your program doesn't crash if the input file is not
found, or if file permissions are incorrect, etc.
Docstring, pseudocode, comments, etc. are not required, but may be helpful for 
partial credit if your code isn't right. <u>[10]</u>

One (very slow) way to calculate the value of &pi; is to compare the area of 
the unit quarter-circle with the area of the unit square.
<br><br>We can estimate this
by generating random points in the unit square (akin to throwing darts at the
unit square), and counting how many lie within the quarter-circle.  
The ratio should approximate &pi;/4 as the number of points increases.
Some helpful hints: <ul>
  <li> The function <tt>random()</tt> in the library <tt>random</tt> returns
  a float between 0 and 1 (including 0.0 but not 1.0).
  <li>Pythagoras' theorem states that for any right triangle with legs
  a and b and hypotenuse c, a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>.
</ul>
<ol class="subparts">
  <li> Your task is to design a function <tt>circle_pi()</tt> that uses the 
  above algorithm to estimate &pi;.  The caller should be able to specify the
  number of points (darts) to use in the approximation.  The function should be
  modular so that other code can easily use it -- it should <b>not</b> do
  any console I/O!  Write a comprehensive <b>docstring</b> for this function
  (but don't implement it yet!), including pre- and post-conditions.  <u>[4]</u>
  <div class="answerblock" style="height:1em"></div>

  <li> Write a comprehensive <b>test suite</b> for this function, including
  both valid and invalid input.  Clearly indicate the invocation and the
  expected result. <u>[4]</u>
  <div class="answerblock" style="height:1em"></div>

  <li> <b>Implement</b> this function in Python.  Pseudocode, comments, etc.
  are not required, but may be helpful for partial credit.
  You should <b>not</b> need to import math!  <u>[6]</u>
