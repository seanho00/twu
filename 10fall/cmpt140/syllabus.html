<tr><th><h2>Objective</h2></th><td>
This course is designed to provide an introduction to <b>programming</b>
and to a modern high level language (Python) so that the student becomes a 
<b>competent programmer</b>. Emphasis is placed on structured programming 
techniques.  By the end of this course the student will be able to 
<b>define</b> a problem, determine the necessary <b>input/output</b> 
requirements, prepare an <b>algorithm</b> to solve the problem, write
structured Python <b>code</b>, <b>debug</b> the program, and produce
<b>documentation</b> specifying how the program can be used and the methods by
which the program achieves its objectives.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Prerequisites</h2></th><td>
    No programming experience is needed, but basic familiarity is expected
    with Windows, navigating directories/files, email/web, etc.
    This course is about problem-solving, developing software tools to help
    others.  It is NOT about hacking together web sites or the like. 
    You must have excellent English skills and the ability to concentrate for
    long periods of time on problem solving.

<tr><th><h2>Notes</h2></th><td>
<ol>

<li> A big part of this course is hands-on learning through programming <b>lab
assignments</b> (about 5-7 total).  Enrolment in this course grants you access
to the <b>CSI computer lab</b> (Neu20), which is reserved for CSI(CMPT) students 
only.  CMPT140 satisfies the <b>natural science</b> but NOT the lab-science 
requirement for a degree at TWU.

<li> <b>ALL</b> labs and homeworks must be done on time.
Homeworks will <b>not</b> be accepted after the day they are due.
<b>Late labs</b> are penalized 10% per calendar day (or portion thereof), and 
are not accepted after 10 days.  The timestamp on MyCourses will be used.
You need to complete <b>all</b> labs; if you miss more than one lab, you
automatically fail the course.

<li> Policy on <b>laptops</b> in class: Laptops are allowed to be used in class
<b>only for course-related work</b>, e.g., following lecture notes online,
trying out Python code interactively, researching add-on libraries pertinent
to the subject, etc.  That means <b>no</b> Facebook, IM, personal email, WoW, 
Halo, etc.!  Students are expected to abide by this on the honour system.

<li> <b>Academic integrity</b> is a core value of the entire TWU community.
This includes, but is not limited to, avoiding all forms of plagiarism and 
cheating.  Plagiarism is using someone else's work without attribution.
In this course, if you do it once you will get a zero, if you do it again you 
will automatically fail the course.  Any such cases also go into the 
University's files for future reference.

A tutorial describing plagiarism and how to avoid it has been
prepared by TWU Librarian William Badke:
<a href="http://www.acts.twu.ca/lbr/plagiarism.ppt">(PPT file)</a>,
<a href="http://www.acts.twu.ca/lbr/Plagiarism.swf">(14 min flash)</a>,
<a href="http://www.acts.twu.ca/lbr/Plagiarism_Short.swf">(8 min flash)</a>

<li> Students who miss more than 25% of class sessions may be barred from taking
the final exam [2010-2011 Academic Calendar p.38].

<li>In case of inclement weather, the TWU campus conditions will be announced
on local radio stations and posted at
<a href="http://www.twu.ca/conditions/"><tt>www.twu.ca/conditions</tt></a>.
