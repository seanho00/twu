Dear Dr. Smith,

Please accept my application for your open position in Computer
Science. As requested in your announcement, I have enclosed the short
version of my vita and a list of three references.

As you can see from the vita, I would provide you with a faculty
member with many years of experience and a recent Ph.D. I believe
this to be a rare combination and one to our mutual advantage.

While my area of specialization is in theoretical computer science, I
have had the opportunity to teach a wide variety of courses during my
18 years at my current institution. In fact, I believe that my
flexibility in the courses I am willing and have experience teaching
is among my strongest assets. When I took my current position I was
looking for a school that valued and rewarded **** teaching. This is
still my highest priority in a new position. Your university seems to
be such a school. I am confident that we are a **** fit for each
other.

On a personal note, my wife and I are both originally from near your
****** and have the majority of our family in that area. We would
look forward to the opportunity to return to your region. Of course
I've known about your university most of my life but I finally got the
chance ***** professionally last Spring when you hosted a recent CS
conference. I enjoyed the ******* setting of your ****** and could be
at home there.

Thank you,




John Doe, Ph.D.
Professor of Computer Science
