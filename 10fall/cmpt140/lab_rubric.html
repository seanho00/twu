  Programming Lab Marking Scheme</h1>

<h2>Lab Write-Up</h2>

For each programming lab you must submit, in addition to your source code, a
detailed and well-written lab write-up.  The lab write-up forms part of the
documentation of your program and is very important -- start on your write-up
<b>before</b> you start on your code!  It should be in clear English, complete
sentences (except pseudocode), and formatted neatly in a document such as
Word .doc, OpenOffice .odt, HTML, PDF, etc.  It is your responsibility to ensure
your TA is able to read your lab write-up.

<p>
<a href="lab_template.html">See the template lab write-up</a> for additional
details.
The write-up must include (in this order):
<ul>
  <li> Planning documents (prepared before writing any code):<ul>
    <li> A brief <b>restatement</b> of the problem in your own words
    <li> A statement on the <b>suitability</b> of solving this problem with a
    computer

    <li> A first refinement of the solution (A statement of the steps required
    to solve the problem):<ul>
      <li> what is given (<b>input</b>)
      <li> what needs to be calculated, including any formulas used (<b>process</b>)
      <li> the <b>output</b> required
    </ul>

    <li> Second <b>refinement</b> / first level of pseudocode:<ul>
      <li> can be sketchy
      <li> may not exactly match the final product, but illustrates first level
      of thinking
      <li> may be handwritten and on a separate sheet
      <li> don't go back and change this after coding
    </ul>

    <li> Third refinement to final <b>pseudocode</b>:<ul>
      <li> Separate pseudocode for each procedure/function, clearly showing any
      algorithms
      <li> should match the final product (or explain why not)
      <li> one line of pseudocode per statement or per block as appropriate
      <li> Examples of pseudocode: <pre>
	print out informative headings and greeting to the user
	compute _____ using (insert formula from first refinement)
	obtain the density of the material from the user
	assign the initial value 3 to the rate of decomposition
	for each element of the array, do the following:
		statement
		statement
	while the value of the month is more than June do
		statement
		statement
	repeat the following steps:
		statement
		statement
	until (some condition is met)</pre>
      <li> DO NOT INCLUDE keywords or key symbols such as '<tt>\n</tt>' or
      <tt>raw_input</tt>, although you may need to use <tt>for, while</tt>, etc.
    </ul>

    <li> If the steps in the third refinement cannot easily be implemented or
    need further breakdown, you may need to include a <b>fourth refinement</b>
    with more sub-steps shown. The rule of thumb is that if the implementation
    of a line of pseudocode is obvious to you, you need not refine it any more;
    otherwise refine to smaller steps until each one is obvious.

    <li> A <b>data table</b>, listing all constants, types, and variables and
    noting all imports:<ul>
      <li> should be by block, including the main block and every procedure
      <li> say what each variable is for
    </ul>

    <li> <b>Sample I/O</b> to illustrate how it is supposed to work<ul>
      <li> NOTE: this is a statement of how it is supposed to work, not how it
      did work. That is, you do this <b>before</b> you write the code, not
      after you run it!
    </ul>

    <li> Documentation for a <em>user</em> to operate the program (a <b>user
      manual</b>):<ul>
      <li> Explanations of error handling and messages (if applicable)
      <li> for every error that may happen, tell how you handle it or why it
      isn't a problem
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <li> <b>Screenshots</b> of several actual runs with real input:<ul>
    <li> Your program should print a welcome message that includes your name or
    other identifying information, so that we know that the screenshot is of
    your program.
    <li> Every feature has to be tested!
    <li> Tests should demonstrate every single error / error message in your
    code.
    <li> Run it several times with a variety of data; think hard about how a
    user might use your program in an unexpected way.
    <li> If there are discrepancies between the predicted I/O and the actual,
    you must explain.
  </ul>
</ul>

TAs are free to adjust this rubric as needed; it is a loose guideline.
If you have a specific question about your lab mark, first ask the TA, then
you may ask the instructor.
