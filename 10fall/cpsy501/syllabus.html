<tr><th><h2>Description</h2></th><td>
An examination of common parametric and non-parametric statistical
techniques used in psychological research, and of principles of accurate
application and interpretation of those techniques (e.g., effect size;
power; sample size; implications of violations of test assumptions). Topics
focus on multiple regression, different models of analysis of variance and
covariance, and also include categorical data analysis, meta-analysis, and
an introduction to interpretation of multivariate statistics.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Objective</h2></th><td>
An emphasis is placed on applied data analysis and accurate conceptualization,
rather than statistical theory.  Students in this course will: <ol>
  <li> Building on a first course in statistics, be able to describe the place
  of statistics in making sense of data and building models of psychological
  phenomena.
  <li> Be able to determine what statistical procedures are appropriate and
  inappropriate to use when analysing a given set of data.
  <li> Conduct a variety of statistical analyses using SPSS, and correctly
  interpret the results.
  <li> Understand statistical concepts and procedures as applied to reading and
  interpreting empirical research, especially as applied in psychotherapy
  research.
  <li> Evaluate and critique interpretations of their own and others'
  statistical analyses, especially as presented in journal articles in the field.
</ol>
</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Software</h2></th><td>
The group project and most of the assignments will require analysis of data,
using <a href="http://www.spss.com/">SPSS (PASW) 17</a>.
This is available on the computers in the Wong Research Centre,
in the CanIL computer lab classroom, and in other labs on campus.
If you wish to purchase a licence for SPSS on your own computer, see
<a href="http://cpsy501.seanho.com/buying-spss.html">
  cpsy501.seanho.com/buying-spss.html</a> for more info.
If you own a different version of SPSS, note that the output files may not be
readable by other versions; you may need to export to PDF or HTML format.

<br><br>
We will also be using the
<a href="http://www.psycho.uni-duesseldorf.de/abteilungen/aap/gpower3/">GPower3</a>
software for power analysis.  This is also installed on campus computers, and 
also freely downloadable for installation on your own computers.
If you are familiar with other power analysis software, you may also use that.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Policies</h2></th><td><ol>
      
<li><b>Attendance</b> is expected for every class.  Course <b>readings</b> are 
to be completed prior to the class for which they are assigned.

<li> The intent of holding lectures in the computing lab is so that students
can try out analyses in SPSS during lecture.  The <b>computers</b> in the
instructional lab should only be used for <b>class-related work</b>, not 
for personal use.

<li> One objective of the course is to prepare you for scholarly research writing
in proper <b>APA style</b>.  As a consequence, later homework assignments and 
especially the project manuscript must be written in 6th Edition APA style, 
especially following the conventions for statistical formatting.  Students should 
also be focusing on professional language, format of tables and figures, and 
referencing.  For grading policy, see the CPSY program manual. 

<li> All assignments are to be submitted electronically, via <b>myCourses</b>.
If there is a problem with myCourses, email it to me.
You can also try scanning in your papers and emailing me the scans.
If all those won't work, you may submit a hard-copy directly to me,
however it is your responsibility to ensure that I receive it on-time.
If you need to submit hard-copies to me outside of classtime, bring it to the
Neufeld receptionists' office and have a staff member timestamp it and send it to me.

<li> Assignments are due by the start of class (<b>9am</b>) on their due dates.

<li> <b>Late</b> submissions are penalized 5% per 24hrs or portion thereof.
The timestamp on the myCourses dropbox will be used to ascertain when an
assignment was submitted.  For example, a homework assignment turned in anytime
between 9am Fri (when it is due) and 9am Sat (the calendar day after) will be
penalized 5%.  The late penalties continue to accrue over weekends and holidays.

<li> Students are encouraged to form study groups and discuss class assignments
together.  Students are also recommended (but not required) to form teams to
do the semester-long data-analysis project.  However, for homework assignments,
it is expected that each person's assignment reports will be <b>individually</b>
written, showing unique differences in language, insights, and formulation of
the results.  

<li> A <b>teaching assistant</b> is available during class time and during her
office hours to consult and assist students with using SPSS. It is not the TA's
responsibility to review students' work, or to help students figure out which
procedures to use in the assignments. Students should contact the instructor
for assistance with understanding course concepts or assignment questions.

</ol></td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Data Analysis Project</h2></th><td>
As a research preparation course, this course is constituted in large part by
a semester-long data analysis project, culminating in a sizeable research
paper with detailed statistical analysis, presented in proper APA style.
The project will involve working together in groups of 2 to 3 people (students
who wish to work solo should check with the instructor) to conduct and write up
a <em>new</em> analysis of a <em>pre-existing</em> data set.  Students are 
encouraged to form groups and obtain data usable data sets as soon as possible.
Groups must have their plans for their project approved by the instructor
before proceeding.  See separate hand-out for additional information on the
requirements and different steps for the project. Together, the various parts
of the group project are worth 45% of the course grade.

<tr><th><h2>Math Advice</h2></th><td>
Many undergraduate students have had negative educational experiences with math
or stats, and some people feel frustrated or anxious with the prospect of
working with numbers.  It helps some people to think of statistical procedures
as decision-making tools, rather than as math problems.  Understanding how the
different procedures are designed help to answer specific research questions is
the central step in learning how to use statistics.    
<br><br>
We suggest that you study together and use each other as resources to help each
other understand the concepts that are taught, and how to use SPSS: in the real
world, you will probably have colleagues with whom you can consult when you are
confronted with difficult clinical cases in your counselling practice.  Treat
your statistics learning in the same way.  And in the same way that you cannot
have a colleague do your counselling sessions for you, we expect everyone to
write up their assignments individually. 
<br><br>
It may help to keep you motivated if you remember that part of being a good
counsellor means staying up to date with the latest developments in your area
of practice.  To be able to evaluate this literature effectively, you need to
know how the authors came up with their conclusions.  For a majority of
published studies in counselling psychology and related fields, this requires
an understanding of statistics and data analysis.

<tr><th><h2>Disabilities</h2></th><td>
While every effort is made to accommodate special needs, unless students
who have disabilities register with the Equity of Access Office at the 
beginning of each semester and identify themselves to the professor of the 
course within the first two weeks of the semester, the professor is not obliged
to make concessions on either the
nature of required assignments or the due dates thereof.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Weather</h2></th><td>
In case of inclement weather, the TWU campus conditions will be announced
on local radio stations and posted on the TWU website at
<a href="http://www.twu.ca/conditions/">www.twu.ca/conditions</a>.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Academic Integrity</h2></th><td>
Academic integrity is a core value of the entire TWU community.
This includes, but is not limited to, avoiding all forms of plagiarism and 
cheating.  TWU has a strict policy concerning plagiarism, and all offenses
are recorded in University files.

A tutorial describing plagiarism and how to avoid it has been
prepared by TWU Librarian William Badke:

</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Additional Resources</h2></th><td>
There are numerous additional resources that can be used to supplement the
material in the required text. Some of these resources are optional, and each
is intended for students in different specific situations.  

<br><br>
If you are not already familiar with how to write and present information in
psychology documents, seriously consider purchasing the APA publication manual
now. Marks will be deducted for failure to use APA format in assignments
and the final project. Pay particular attention to (a) the format of tables
(pp. 147-176), (b) statistical notation and formatting (pp. 136-146); and (c)
citation/referencing details (pp. 215-281). 
<ul>
  <li> American Psychological Association. (2009).
  <i>Publication manual of the American Psychological Association</i>
  (6th ed.), Washington, DC.  ISBN 1-4338-0561-8.
</ul>

If you are uncomfortable with statistics and quantitative reasoning, or it has
been a long time since you completed your basic stats course, you may want to
consider purchasing the following text, which provides one kind of introductory
information: 
<ul>
  <li> Kranzner, G., Moursund, J., Kranzler, J. (2006).
  <i>Statistics for the terrified</i> (3rd ed.).
  Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.  ISBN 0132328860.
</ul>

If you are less-than-fully-comfortable with computers, and want more detailed,
step-by-step instructions than Field provides for using SPSS, then you might
find the following work-book useful (note, however, that it was written for
SPSS 15, not SPSS 17:
<ul>
  <li> Pallant, J. (2007).  <i>SPSS survival manual</i> (3nd ed.).
  Allen &amp; Unwin.  ISBN 1741762421.
</ul>

The use of multivariate statistics is quite common in counselling psychology,
although there are also are frequent problems arising in journal publications.
To get you started:

  <i>Reading and understanding multivariate statistics</i>.
  Washington, DC: APA. [QA278 .R43 1995]
