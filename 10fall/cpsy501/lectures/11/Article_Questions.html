    CPSY 501 Fall 2010</a> Research Article Review Questions</h1>

Before class, please read these two journal articles and try to
understand their statistical analyses.  Come prepared to discuss
the following review questions.

<h2>Myers &amp; Hayes, 2006</h2>
<center><small>
  Myers, D., &amp; Hayes, J. A. (2006).
  Effects of therapist general self-disclosure and countertransference
  disclosure on ratings of the therapist and session.
  <em>Psychothearpy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training</em>,
  <em>43</em>(2), 173-185.
</small></center>

<ol>
  <li> How many '<b>cells</b>' in this study?
  What are each of the <b>predictors</b> and their levels?

  <li> "Pearson's correlation coefficients among the dependent measures
  ranged from .13 to .69" (p. 179)<br>
  What <b>assumption</b> of parametric data are they addressing with this 
  information?
 
  <li> Using the graph of the <b>interaction</b> between Working Alliance 
  and Self-Disclosure on Expertness ratings as a guide, draw 
  <b>another graph</b> that presents the same data in a different way.
</ol>

<h2>Horowitz, et al., 2007</h2>
<center><small>
  Horowitz, J. L., Garber, J., Ciesla, J. A., Young, J. F., &amp; Mufson, L.
  (2007).
  Prevention of depressive symptoms in adolescents: A randomized trial
  of cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal prevention programs.
  <em>Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology</em>,
  <em>75</em>(5), 693-706.
</small></center>

<ol>
  <li> Given the core assumptions for <b>ANCOVA</b> (both statistical and 
  conceptual), do you think these authors make a good case for including
  <b>pre-treatment</b> depression scores as a covariate?  Why or why not?
  <em>(See <a href="../08/">lecture08 on ANCOVA</a>.)</em>

  <li> The author's third moderation hypothesis (c) expected to see 
  a stronger effect for the <b>interpersonal</b> program on depressive
  symptoms if the participant had higher <b>sociotropy</b> scores.
  Does the <b>graph</b> of the interaction (Figure 3, p. 700) appear to 
  support that hypothesis?
</ol>
