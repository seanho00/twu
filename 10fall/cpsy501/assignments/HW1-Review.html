<h1><a href="http://twu.seanho.com/10fall/cpsy501/">
    CPSY 501 Fall 2010</a> HW Assignment #1:<br> Statistics Review / SPSS Intro</h1>

<h3>Total: 20 marks. Due: Fri 24Sep 09:00am, uploaded to myCourses</h3>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
Please download from the course website (under "assignments") and use the
<a href="HW1-ADD.sav"><tt>HW1-ADD.sav</tt></a> dataset for this assignment.
This dataset is from 9th grade students who show behavioural tendencies that
can be described more-or-less like Attention Deficit Disorder symptoms.

<ol>

<li> <h3>Variable Labels and Levels (5 marks)</h3>
The dataset has been sloppily formed and doesn't even have proper labels or
levels of measurement for each of the variables.  Modify the SPSS file to
show proper labels for each variable as given below, and also set the proper
level of measurement: Scale (interval or ratio), ordinal, or nominal.
For the nominal variables, set the "Value" labels as indicated below.
<table border="1">
  <tr><th>Col#</th><th>Variable</th><th>Values</th></tr>
  <tr><td>2</td><td>ADDSC score</td><td>higher = more "problems"</td></tr>
  <tr><td>3</td><td>Gender</td><td>1 = Male, 2 = Female</td></tr>
  <tr><td>4</td><td>Repeat a grade</td><td>0 = No, 1 = Yes</td></tr>
  <tr><td>5</td><td>IQ: "Intelligence" score</td><td>higher = more ability</td></tr>
  <tr><td>6</td><td>English course level in 9th grade</td><td>
      1 = College/Univ prep, 2 = General, 3 = Remedial</td></tr>
  <tr><td>7</td><td>English course grade</td><td>4 = A, 3 = B, etc.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>8</td><td>Grade point average in 9th grade</td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>9</td><td>Social problems at home</td><td>0 = No, 1 = Yes</td></tr>
  <tr><td>10</td><td>Dropout</td><td>0 = No, 1 = Yes</td></tr>
</table>

<li> <h3>IQ and English Grade (5 marks)</h3>
One question this research addresses is whether intelligence scores are
strongly associated with "English course grade" for the population of 9th grade
students from which this sample was drawn. What kind of correlation coefficient
provides the correct strategy for answering that question?  Calculate the
proper result using SPSS and indicate whether the result can be accurately
described as "large" using the convention described in the textbook. How
would your analysis strategy have changed if you were correlating "English
course level in 9th grade" with IQ?

<li> <h3>Social Problems and Dropping Out (5 marks)</h3>
If we want explore whether social problems at home are associated with the
likelihood of dropping out of school, how do we approach that question? What do
the results from this sample suggest?

<li> <h3>Gender and ADD (5 marks)</h3>
Does the data in this sample support the stereotype that boys with ADD symptoms
tend to be "worse" (showing more problems) than girls showing the same kinds of
tendencies? Since we have a friend who believes that stereotype, we need to be
convincing and careful.  So, in addition to checking the stereotype
statistically, print out the boxplots for girls and for boys to help show what
is going on.  <em>(Hint: we need the boxplots to be presented side-by-side to be
  more convincing!</em>

</ol>

<h2 class="break">Formatting</h2>
Format your answers to questions #2-4 in a single document (Word .doc or
similar), clearly formatted and written in complete sentences.  For this first
assignment, strict APA style is not necessary (but it will be for subsequent
assignments, so you should get some practise!).  Include any relevant plots as
figures within your document (again, APA style not necessary for this assignment).
Also create a <b>clean</b> SPSS output file (.spv) showing the relevant analyses and
plots.  Make sure your SPSS output file doesn't have any output from any other
"trial runs" you did!  It is possible to edit an output file to delete extraneous
output.

<h2>Turn-in</h2>
You should upload to myCourses the following:<ul>
  <li> Your write-up as a Word .doc (or similar)
  <li> Your edited HW1-ADD.sav dataset (with proper variable labels, etc.)
  <li> Your clean SPSS output file (.spv)
</ul>
