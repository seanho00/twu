There will be a quiz each Friday. It will consist of a few
questions taken directly from the assigned homework. So if
you do all the homework then the quiz will be familiar.
<br><b>NOTE:</b> Absence from a quiz will only be excused for medical
reasons and with a doctor's note.

<tr><th><h2>Notes</h2></th><td>
<ul>

<li> Mathematics is cumulative in nature -- if you miss a class or have a gap in
your understanding of the material, you can't just "skip" it and come back to
it later; you must fill in the gap first before you can move on.  This means
that it is imperative you keep up with the material and ask for help
immediately if you feel yourself falling behind.

<li> You are encouraged to make study groups and work together on the homework
assignments, but you should understand the concepts and do the final draft
on your own.  The work you hand in must be solely your own work.
Copying somebody else's work is stealing, and claiming somebody else's work
as your own is also lying.  Such cases can be detected, and will be reported
to the University for further disciplinary action; you will also fail the
course.

<li> Students who miss more than 25% of class sessions may be barred from taking
the final exam [2004-2005 Academic Calendar p.34].

<li> In case of inclement weather, the TWU campus conditions will be announced
on local radio stations and posted on the TWU website; please
see <a href="http://www.twu.ca/conditions/">www.twu.ca/conditions</a>.
