<tr><th><h2>Description</h2></th><td width="100%">
The elements of modern word processing. Whatever the standard application in use at the time, emphasis will be on the principles of word processing, not the particular details of a single application. While instruction will necessarily be on a single platform, students may practice on either Windows based or MacOS based machines, as the software is identical.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Objectives</h2></th><td width="100%">
The students will learn to use Microsoft Word 2003, a popular word processor, to create, edit, and print documents.

<tr><th><h2>Notes</h2></th><td width="100%">
<ol>
<li> Two hour "hands-on" lessons are conducted weekly in the instructional lab. Students will require additional practice time in the general computer lab or on their own computers.
<li> There is a lab fee for this course.
<li> A passing grade will be impossible if more than two of the lab assignments are not submitted for marking or if proficiency in using the applications cannot be demonstrated.
<li> Lab assignments are due in class on specified dates. OVERDUE labs lose 4% per day up to a week. After that, they are not accepted.
<li> Practice lab times will be arranged during the first full week of classes. These assigned lab times will be two hours per week. Students may require more or less time to complete assignments.
</ol>
</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Assignments</h2></th><td width="100%">
<ol>
<li> Assignments must be printed out or emailed before class and turned in
to the instructor at the start of your weekly class period.  Attach the file 
and email to your instructor
with "<tt>Assignment # ___ [Your Name]</tt>" in the subject. 
Please also name your file "<tt>Assignment # ___ [Your Name]</tt>", 
with the appropriate extension (e.g. "<tt>.doc</tt>").
<li> Remember: if you miss handing in 3 of the 5 assignments, you will 
automatically fail the course.
It is better to hand in an incomplete assignment than none at all.
<li> While asking other students for help is valid, taking someone else’s work,
changing it a little, and handing it in as your own is not.  Such activities
rob you of the learning experience you are paying for, cheat the students who
get marks by doing their own work, and are considered an insult to the
Instructor.  Markers have been told to be alert for instances of fraud.
They will be brought to the Instructor’s attention and dealt with according to
department policy.
</ol>

<tr><th><h2>Inclement Weather</h2></th><td width="100%">
In the event of deteriorating weather conditions overnight or other emergency situations, every effort will be made to communicate information regarding the cancellation of classes to the radio stations CKNW (980 AM), CKWX (1130 AM), MAX (850 AM), PRAISE (106.5 FM) and KARI (550 AM) by 6:30 a.m., and an announcement will be placed on the University's switchboard (604-888-7511) and website (<a href="http://www.twu.ca/conditions/">http://www.twu.ca/conditions/</a>). The first announcement regarding a closure will cover the period up to 1:00 p.m. only. If classes are to be cancelled beyond 1:00 p.m., this decision will be announced by the same means before 11:00 a.m. that day. Students and faculty should assume that all night classes will continue to operate. If the emergency continues into the evening, students and faculty may check for a closure notice on the University's switchboard and website after 3:00 p.m. that day.
