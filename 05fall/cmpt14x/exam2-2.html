<li>
Explain all the differences between <b>assignment</b>
<br>compatibility and <b>expression</b> compatibility.
<br>Give examples.
<br><br><br><br><br>

<li>
Explain all the differences between the built-in <b>string concatenation</b>
operator (<b>+</b>) and the standard library function <tt>Strings.Concat()</tt>.
<br><br><br><br>

<li>
Explain the advantages and disadvantages of 
<b><tt>FOR</tt></b> versus <b><tt>WHILE</tt></b>.
<br>Be specific (not just "one is more flexible").

The following module will not compile.  What is <b>wrong</b>?
  How would you <b>fix</b> it?
<pre>
MODULE BuggyReadVector;
	(* user inputs values to initialize a vector *)
FROM SWholeIO IMPORT
	ReadCard;
VAR
	myVector : ARRAY [1 .. 11] OF CARDINAL;
	count, counter : CARDINAL;
BEGIN
	FOR count := 1 TO 10
		DO
			counter := count;
			ReadCard (count);
			SkipLine;
			myVector [counter] := count;
		END;
	myVector [counter + 1] := 11;
END BuggyReadVector.

<li>
In the remainder of this exam, you will be writing up a library and test-suite
for generating <b>pseudorandom</b> numbers:

Your library should provide a <tt>Random()</tt> function, which returns 
a new random real between 0 and 1 each time it is invoked.  There should 
also be a way to <b>seed</b> the random number generator.  The default seed 
(if the user does not manually set it) should be 0. 

  <ol class="subparts">

  <li> Write a complete Modula-2 <b>DEFINITION</b> file for your library
  (call it <tt>PseudoRandom</tt>).  In comments after each procedure 
  declaration, define brief <b>preconditions</b> and <b>postconditions</b>
  for that procedure.

  <li> Write a brief <b>user manual</b> for your <tt>PseudoRandom</tt> library.
  Your target audience is a fellow Modula-2 programmer who doesn't know
  how your library works, but wants to use it in his/her own program.
  Include a short <b>abstract</b> at the beginning of the user manual:
  one or two sentences summarizing the purpose of this library.
  Include a couple <b>examples</b> of how to use your library.

  <li> Write <b>pseudocode</b> for each procedure in your library.
  You may wish to design additional helper functions for internal use 
  within your library, as appropriate; if you do, then write pseudocode 
  for them, too.

  <li> List all <b>libraries</b> and library items you need to import.

  <li> List any <b>variables</b> (and their types) you will declare in the
  scope of the library implementation module.  Also, for each procedure in
  your library (including helper functions), list any variables (and their
  types) local to that procedure.

  <li> Write a complete Modula-2 <b>IMPLEMENTATION</b> file for your library.

  <li> Write a separate <b>test suite</b> (test harness, test framework)
  for your library -- a complete Modula-2 program module that imports from
  your library.  This program should produce 1,000 random <b>CARDINALS</b>
  between 0 and 9,999 and save them into a file of the user's choosing.
  The numbers should be formatted ten per row, in <b>columns</b>: e.g.,
  <pre>
	9472 3930 4876  239 1029   12 7349 1920    0 2382
	3390 1528    3 5867 9999 8821 2002   77 1103  902
	....</pre>

  </ol>

<b>Notes:</b><ul>
<li>
Although your pseudorandom number generator won't be "truly" random, 
you should take reasonable efforts to make it not trivial.

<li>
You may use LONGREALs if you wish, but you are not required to.

<li>
Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper.
You may wish to write rough drafts and/or sketch your design ideas on a 
separate sheet of paper.  This is fine (and might even help with partial 
credit), but just make sure you have a clean, neatly written final version
of each part of the question, clearly indicating which part of the problem
it answers.

<li>
Please try to indent and format your code properly so it can be read easily.
Unless otherwise specified, comments within your code are not required on this
exam, however if your code is incorrect, your comments may earn you partial
credit if they show good design thinking.  Little partial credit will be
given for uncommented incorrect code.

<li>
If you are short on time, prioritize getting the design and main ideas right
and don't worry as much about the details of syntax.  Forgetting a semicolon
or misspelling IMPELLEMANETATATION is not a big deal.
</ul>
