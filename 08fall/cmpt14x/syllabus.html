<tr><th><h2>Objective</h2></th><td>
This group of courses is designed to provide an introduction to programming 
and to a modern high level language (Python) so that the student becomes a 
competent programmer. Emphasis is placed on Structured Programming techniques.
By the end of this course the student will be able to define a problem,
determine the necessary input/output requirements, prepare an algorithm to 
solve the problem, write structured Python code, debug the program, and 
produce documentation specifying how the program can be used and the methods 
by which the program achieves its objectives.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Prerequisites</h2></th><td>
<ul>
<li>140: B.C. High School Computer Science 11, Cmpt 100/112/115 OR equivalent.
<li>141: Algebra 12 AND high school programming in C, Pascal, or Java OR equivalent with marks of at least a "B".
<li>143: University credit for a programming language such as C, Pascal, or Ada
<li>145: TWU CMPT 140 or the equivalent
</ul>
</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Notes</h2></th><td>
<ol>

<li> The normal sequence for most students is 140 and 145 (5hrs total).
You must take 145 if you wish to take ANY more computing science courses.

<li> CMPT 145 students not taking 140 this year must do labs #4, #5, and #6
with a complete writeup.  145 students may but are not required to join
the lectures in progress before the midterm/140 final 
(about 6 weeks into the course.)

<li> All three of 140/141/143 and of 141/143/145 are offered by the same 
instructor at the same time and in the same classroom except that the 140 and 
145 students have an additional lecture each Thursday for introductory material,
extra examples, and more review time. 141/143 students may attend this 
session if they wish.  141/143 students are still responsible for knowing the
content of any posted lecture notes from the Thursday lectures.

<li> This course will require four (141/143/145) or five (140) hours of class 
time per week and laboratory time of about four hours per week (likely two for 
143) using one of the school computers. There is a lab fee. This course
satisfies the science but NOT the labscience requirement for a degree at 
Trinity Western University.

<li> All labs must be done on time.  If two are missing, there is no credit 
for the course.  Sign up for one of the weekly lab sections (MTW 18:00-22:00);
your labs are due
on the first lab section after the due date posted in the course schedule.

<li> Use any other person's work without attribution and you get zero; 
do it twice and there will be no credit for the course. Any such cases also 
go into the University's files for future reference.

<li> This is a course in the fundamentals of a scientific discipline, NOT 
about hacking together web sites or the like. You must have excellent English 
and the ability to concentrate for long periods of time on problem solving.

<li> Students who miss more than 25% of class sessions may be barred from taking
the final exam [2008-2009 Academic Calendar p.38].

<li>In case of inclement weather, the TWU campus conditions will be announced
on local radio stations and posted on the TWU website; for more details please
see <a href="http://www.twu.ca/conditions/">www.twu.ca/conditions</a>.

<li>
As Christian scholars pursuing higher education, academic integrity is a core 
value of the entire TWU community. Students are invited into this scholarly
culture and required to abide by the principles of sound academic scholarship
at TWU. This includes, but is not limited to, avoiding all forms of plagiarism
and cheating in scholarly work. TWU has a strict policy on plagiarism (see
academic calendar 2008-09, pp. 37-38). Learning what constitutes plagiarism and
avoiding it is the student's responsibility. An excellent resource describing
plagiarism and how to avoid it has been prepared by TWU Librarian William Badke
and is freely available for download

<tr><th><h2>Journals (Daily Devotions)</h2></th><td>
This course will give you some essential tools for software design; in 
the same way, an essential tool for your spiritual growth is God's Word, the
"owner's manual" for our lives.  You need to be reading the Bible and praying
every day or you will not be a well-equipped toolsmith.  To help keep you 
accountable, I ask that by the start of every class you email or hand in a 
sheet of paper with
<ul>
	<li> your name and student number, and 
	<li> for each of the days since the last time you handed in a sheet,
	<ul>
		<li> that day's date,
		<li> the reference to the passage you read on that day, and
		<li> a short sentence or two describing what you learned 
		from that passage (e.g., a principle for life, a promise
		from God, an aspect of God's character).
       	</ul>
</ul>
If you miss a few days, it's okay, but do try to make it up later.
I'll record that you did your journals and give them back to you; 
I look forward to learning from your insights into the Scripture!
