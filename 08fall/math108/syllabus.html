<tr><th><h2>Description</h2></th><td>
This course is an introduction to applied statistics addressed, in particular, to students specializing in the field of nursing. The focus is on developing the conceptual aspects of the subject rather than the mathematical foundations and assumes no prerequisite except elementary algebra. Topics include descriptive statistics, probability, the normal, t-, chi-square and F-distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, correlation and regression, ANOVA. Applications are directed towards health and biological studies.

<tr><th><h2>Objective</h2></th><td>
By the end of the course students should be able to <ul>
<li> understand the principles underlying statistical procedures
<li> use the most common statistical tools
<li> demonstrate the use of statistical reasoning in health and biological sciences
</ul>

<tr><th><h2>Prerequisites</h2></th><td>
A minimum of C in  BC Math , Principles of Mathematics 11.
Note that credit cannot be obtained for both MATH102 and MATH108.

for a number of years will need to catch up on their own and
perhaps find a private tutor (see TWUSA).

<tr><th><h2> Academic Integrity and Avoiding Plagiarism at TWU </h2></th><td>
As Christian scholars pursuing higher education, academic integrity is a core 
value of the entire TWU community. Students are invited into this scholarly
culture and required to abide by the principles of sound academic scholarship
at TWU. This includes, but is not limited to, avoiding all forms of plagiarism
and cheating in scholarly work. TWU has a strict policy on plagiarism (see
academic calendar 2008-09, pp. 37-38). Learning what constitutes plagiarism and
avoiding it is the student's responsibility. An excellent resource describing
plagiarism and how to avoid it has been prepared by TWU Librarian William Badke
and is freely available for download
