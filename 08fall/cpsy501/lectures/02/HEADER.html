Addenda/corrections after lecture:
<ul>
  <li> I misspoke in class about the "Ratio" level of measurement and how it 
  compares with "Interval":<ul>
    <li> <b>Interval</b> applies if an <em>additive</em> change to the values
    is always commensurate: e.g., if changing a score from 10 to 20 is
    commensurate with changing a score from 80 to 90.
    <li> <b>Ratio</b> applies if any <em>multiplicative</em> change to the
    values is always commensurate: e.g., if changing a score from 10 to 20 is
    commensurate with changing a score from 30 to 60 (multiplying it by 2).
  </ul>
  In SPSS both are called "Scale".  See Fields p.49 for more details.

  <li> Exporting PDF: if you have only one output window open in SPSS, you can
  choose the "File" menu, "Export...", and under "Document", set the Type to 
  "Portable Document Format (*.pdf)".  Select a filename under your 
  "My Documents" (be sure to choose a file extension of ".pdf"), and press OK.
  <br>I had problems doing that in class because I had two output windows open.

  <li> Please make sure to close SPSS when you are done working on it.  We have
  a "floating licence" on campus, which means that at any time we can have up
  to 40 people running SPSS at a time.

</ul>
