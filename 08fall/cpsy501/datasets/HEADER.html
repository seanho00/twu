    CPSY 501 Fall 2008</a>: CPSY Quantitative Data Set List</h1>

Jessica and Shirley Busby have kindly compiled an updated list of
quantitative data sets created by past CPSY student theses and projects.
You may choose one of these, or another data set of your choosing, for your
big data analysis course project.  Each of these data sets is the property
of its respective owners, so you do need to contact the owners to get
permission to use their data!

<p>Jessica has a DVD with all the actual data, but before she can give you
access to the data you need permission from the owners, and the data needs
to be cleaned of any identifying labels (e.g., participant names, etc.).

<p>The list of data sets is at
