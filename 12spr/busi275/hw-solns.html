<div>All homeworks should be turned in electronically to myCourses.
  Homeworks are due by 10pm on the due date.
  <br>
  Submit each homework as two files: one text document (e.g., Word)
  with complete English sentences answering the questions,
  and one Excel spreadsheet showing the work you did to produce the
  results in the text document.  (A suggestion is to create one tab/worksheet
  in Excel for each question, and label it according to the question number.)
  <br>
  Please name your files according to the pattern: "Doe_Jane_HW1.doc" and
  "Doe_Jane_HW1.xls" (i.e., start with your last name).
  <br>
  A quasi-random sampling of questions from each HW will be selected for marking.
</div>

<div>Datasets for textbook problems are

<h2><a name="1">HW1 (due Thu 19 Jan) (30pts)</a></h2><ul>
  <li> p.24, #1-54, 1-58
<i><br>#1-54: (a) cross-sectional, (b) ratio, (c) ordinal
<br>#1-58 <u>[5]</u>: (a) cross-sectional, (b) quantitative: D, E
(c) A,B,C,F: nominal; D,E: ratio</i>
  <li> p.28, #1-66, 1-68
<i><br>#1-66: (a) no, (b) only <em>Oregonian</em> readers, emailers;
participants may be concerned about being identified by email address, etc.
<br>#1-68 <u>[3]</u>: survey energy drink consumers: e.g., phone survey, link on 
bottle label to online survey, in-store questionnaire, etc.
Alternatively: try selling both bottles and cans (holding all other factors
constant) and see which sells more.  For each sale, the variable is a nominal 
(dichotomous, qualitative) variable: packaging type (can vs. bottle).
Lots of possible answers here; the point is just to demonstrate some thinking of
how you'd actually go about gathering the data.</i>
  <li> p.51, #2-2, 2-10, 2-16, 2-18
<i><br>#2-2: 2<sup>11</sup>=2048, so at least 11 bins.
<br>#2-10: over half (56%) of orders have between 4-6 line items, and an
additional one-quarter of orders are larger with between 7-9 items.
The most frequently-occurring number of items was 6.
The largest order had 12 items.  <em>(histogram)</em>
<br>#2-16 <u>[6]</u>: (a) <em>(histogram, make sure all 45 observations are covered by the
8 bins)</em>, (b) 48.9% (22/45) rates are 5.74% or higher. (c) <em>(ogive)</em>
<br>#2-18: (a) <em>(histogram w/8 bins)</em>.  (b) 50% of the tires have a tread life
of at least 60k miles, and 10% have a tread life of at least 66k miles.
The longest-lasting tire lasted 74k miles, and the shortest-lasting was 52k
miles.  (c) <em>(histogram w/12 bins)</em> in this case, the 12-bin histogram
shows more detail, however the general features of the distribution are visible
in both: skewed right, slightly bimodal with a large peak at 58-59k and a
smaller peak at 63-64k.  </i>
  <li> p.63, #2-26, 2-28, 2-40
<i><br>#2-26: (a) (b) <em>(bar, pie charts)</em>. (c) each has its pros/cons;
the pie chart is more appropriate if the given categories are exhaustive, i.e.
all students fall into one of the given categories.  This is not always the
case, e.g., some students might not be in a degree program, or 5th-year 
students might not be counted under "Senior".  (In the U.S., "freshman"
corresponds to "first year"; "sophomore" to "second year", etc.)
<br>#2-28: (a) (b) <em>(pie charts)</em>. (c) <em>(a clustered bar chart
might be a good way to compare the two)</em>
<br>#2-40 <u>[5]</u>: (a) (b) <em>(bar, pie charts)</em>. (c) pie chart might be better
for these percentages, <b>however</b> one needs to add an "Other" category
(9.5%).  </i>
  <li> p.74, #2-53, 2-60
<i><br>#2-53 <u>[4]</u>: (a) (b) <em>(line charts)</em>.  (c) <em>(parallel line charts
make sense for this time-series data; a scatterplot of earnings vs. 
dividends would also be fine (although it loses the time information)</em>
<br>#2-60: (a) <em>(line chart)</em>. (b) the most noticeable effect is simply
an increase in federal flood insurance coverage over time. (c) Calculating
the difference between consecutive years (using Excel) and finding the average
of those differences, we find that federal flood insurance increases by
an average of $38.57 billion per year.  </i>
  <li> p.79, #2-74, 2-78, Case 2.1
<i><br>#2-74 <u>[7]</u>: (a) <em>(best to have a single line chart with two data series,
so we can compare, but two line charts is also okay)</em>.  California generally
tracks the national average, but is always higher, even more so from weeks
20-35 (Mar-Jun).  (b) CA price reached its peak of $3.15 in week 50.  (c) Min
CA price was $1.97 in week 16.  Estimating a straight line between these two
points, we get a line of the form: Price = (0.03459)*Week + 1.420.  Solving
for when Price = $4.00, we get Week = 74.6.
<br>#2-78: <em>(histogram: can be on CA, or NatAve, or just all the data)</em>
All histograms show that diesel prices generally stay below a threshold
($2.56 for CA, $2.43 for Natl).  The outliers above that (up to $3.15 for CA,
$2.90 for Natl) are weeks when the prices were unusually high.
<br>Case 2.1: <em>(bar chart, histogram, and pie chart)</em>
</i>
</ul>

<h2><a name="2">HW2 (due Thu 26 Jan) (30pts)</a></h2><ul>
  <li> p.74, #2-59
<i><br>#2-59: (line chart with two data series) The adjusted prices are useful
because looking only at the actual prices one might think gasoline prices have
been rising steadily since 1970, but actually this is due to inflation. Adjusted
prices have remained steady except for the oil crisis from 1980-1985, and the
dramatic increase from 2002 on.  </i>
  <li> p.104, #3-6, 3-14, 3-18, 3-23
<i><br>#3-6: (boxplots) Excel and manual calculation give different results;
either is fine.  <br>Q1: 22.25 or 21.5; Q3: 44.25 or 44.5; 90th: 68.5 or 79;
20th: 19.6 or 19; 30th: 23.  Median: 27.5; min: 12; max: 106;
lower fence: -10.75 or -13; upper fence: 77.25 or 79.
   <br>#3-14: simple mean is $77, weighted mean is $83.25: yields average price
per sqft across all 6 buildings; larger buildings have more sqft and hence get
weighted more.
   <br>#3-18: (MBA Analysis): lots of observations that could be made: dramatic
difference between mean and median in post-MBA salary and % increase are due to
significantly higher post-MBA salary at Stanford and UPenn; they also have
significantly higher tuition and student cost.  BYU looks to be a relative
bargain with very low costs but high admissions criteria; although their post-MBA
salary is below average, the % increase is above the median.
   <br>#3-23: (a) (boxplot): mean = $3061.56, median = $3065.04, Q1 = $2902.76,
Q3 = $3231.72, min = $2522.15, max = $3734.50, lower fence = $2409.32,
upper fence = $3725.16.
<br>(b) Looks pretty symmetric.  (c) About 52%; this range is just a little
more than the range from Q1 to Q3 (which would cover 50%).
   </i>
  <li> p.116, #3-36, 3-40, 3-42
<i><br>#3-36: Mean = $12723, SD = $4523.53.  Assuming a normal distribution,
approximately two-thirds (68%) of RV loans are between $8199 and $17246.
The CV of 36% is pretty high; there is a large variability in loan balance.
   <br>#3-40: (a) mean = $898.03, SD = $222.79.  (b) max is at z = 2.225.
90th percentile in 1988 dollars is $1124.90 (or $1147.82 manually).
In 2012 dollars (24 years) with simple interest, $2744.75 (or $2800.67).
In 2012 dollars with compound interest, $4554.64 (or $4647.43).
   <br>#3-42: (MBA Analysis): lots more observations could be made: entrance
requirements (GPA and GMAT scores) are pretty uniform (low SD / low CV),
but tuition / costs vary considerably.
   </i>
  <li> p.125, #3-58, 3-64
<i><br>#3-58: (a) mean = 111.36, SD = 22.42.  (b) mean = 150.86, SD = 26.84.
(c) Eng = 20%, Span = 18%.  English-speaking reps have greater relative
variability.  (d) (boxplots) Although relative variability is a bit higher
for English, this is primarily because overall calls are longer for Spanish;
the absolute variability (SD) and min/max range are larger for Spanish.
   <br>#3-64: (a) mean = 1.6848, SD = 0.003825. (b) diameter must be positive,
so it can't be completely normal, but the CV is quite small, so the distrib
stays well away from zero, so it could be normal.  (c) 1 SD: 28/45 = 62%,
Tch says &ge;0%.  2 SDs: 43/45 = 96%, Tch says &ge;75%.  3 SDs: 100%, Tch says
89%.  (This distrib does fit well with Empirical Rule!)
  </i>
  <li> p.131, #3-76, 3-80
<i><br>#3-76: (a) NORMDIST(507, 407, 100, 1) = 84.13%.
(b) NORMINV(0.25, 407, 100) = $339.55.  (c) $250 corresponds to a z-score of
z = 1.57.  Tchebysheff's rule says that at least 1 - 1/1.57^2 = 59.43% of
flights must lie at least that close to the mean; this means up to 40.57% of
flights are allowed to be further from the mean than $250 is.  The distribution
need not be symmetric; all of that 40.57% could be in the left-hand tail of the
distribution, so the largest percentile that $250 could be is the 41st percentile.
   <br>#3-80: (a) Growth CV = 25%, Specialized CV = 33%: Specialized is more 
volatile.  (b) Risk-averse should stick with Growth. (c) Despite the volatility,
overall returns with Specialized are much higher than with Growth; the average
return is significantly higher.

<h2><a name="3">HW3 (due Thu  2 Feb) (30pts)</a></h2><ul>
  <li> p.133, #3-88, 3-92
<i><br>#3-88: (a) Calif's SD is larger. (b) Calif: mean = $91215, median = $90496.50.
Fl: mean = $68821, median = $68402.50.  (c) Calif CV = $8.55%, Fl CV = 7.69%.
California has larger relative dispersion.
   <br>#3-92: (a) 151/200 = 75.5% of trucks are at or below 45,000lbs.
(b) mean = 42260.64, median = 42325.5.  (c) 8 bins; Q1 = 39686.5, Q3 = 44923.
Boxplot is more compact, but histogram tells more.  Fairly symmetric, only slight
left skew.  Not too far off of normal.  (d) Since more than 3/4 of Cozine's
trucks are under the target weight, and both mean/median are over 2500lbs below
the target weight, a rate adjustment down closer to 42,000lbs would be fair and
beneficial to Cozine.</i>
  <li> p.137, Case 3.4 (write a report)
<i><br>Case 3.4: lots to explore in this complex dataset: staff were rated higher
than equipment, with exercise programs rated worst, and overall service in between.
Most have been with the club 4 years or less, and visit between 1-3 times per week.
Over 2/3 female, mostly between the ages of 28-40, but a smooth falloff with age.
</i>
  <li> p.157, #4-8, 4-22, 4-24
<i><br>#4-8: (a) 40.40%.  (b) 15.80%.  (c) 10.40%.
   <br>#4-22: (a) P(daily) = 72/238 = 30.25%.  (b) P(VeryAd | Busi) = 9/55 = 16.36%.
   <br>#4-24: (a) P(signal or coverage) = (76+64)/1087 = 12.88%.
<br>(b) P( (signal or coverage) and (56-65 or 66-75) ) = (11+1+8+8)/1087 = 2.58%.
<br>(c) P(safety or internet) = (283+218)/1087 = 46.09%.
<br>(d) P( (signal or coverage) | (15-25 or 26-35) ) = (13+19+13+15)/(201+205) = 14.78%.
  </i>
  <li> p.180, #4-28, 4-35, 4-50, 4-54
<i><br>#4-28: (a) 1/3 chance that the brand she omitted was the one she needed,
so P(wife correct) = 2/3.
(b) husband must not have communicated with wife (otherwise he would know the 
correct brand), so they are independent.  So also P(husband fail) = 1/3.
Hence P(wife fail and husband fail) = P(wife fail) P(husband fail) = (1/3)(1/3)
 = 1/9.
  <br>#4-35: (a) P(F and stops) = P(F) P(stops | F) = (0.518)(0.61) = 31.6%.
<br>(b) P(stops) = P(F and stops) + P(M and stops) = (0.518)(0.61) + (0.482)(0.42)
 = 31.6% + 20.2% = 51.8%.
<br>(c) P(M | stops) = P(M and stops) / P(stops) = 0.202 / 0.518 = 39.05%.
  <br>#4-50: (a) P(private) = 63.9%.
<br>(b) P(&gt;20) = 9.98%.
<br>(c) P(private and &gt;20) = 2.84%.
<br>(d) P(CA)^2 = (0.0538)^2 = 0.29%.  Very unlikely to happen, so if it does,
we suspect favouritism.
   <br>#4-54: (a) P(Dell and (not HS)) = (11+2)/100 = 13%.
<br>(b) P((not HS) | Dell) = (11+2)/33 = 39.39%.
<br>(c) P(not HS) = (30+11+2+3)/100 = 46% does not match P((not HS) | Dell),
so the two are not independent.  People who achieve at least a bachelor's degree
are less likely to own a Dell.  </i>
  <li> p.188, #4-72 <em>(change "Salt Lake City" to "Atlanta")</em>, Case 4.2
<i><br>#4-72: (a) P(Atlanta) = 24/110 = 21.82%.
<br>(b) P(wiring) = 23/100 = 20.91%.
<br>(c) P(Atlanta and wiring) = 8/110 = 7.27%.
<br>(d) P(day and Atlanta and wiring) = 8/110 = 7.27%.
<br>(e) Most likely case is Day-Boise-Lens (21/110); the next most likely
is Day-Boise-Corrosion (20/110).
   <br>Case4.2: (1) P(wrong) = 2/3. (2) No, does not change the probability
that your original choice was correct.  (3) Yes, you should switch!
Probability that door 3 is correct is now 2/3.

  <li> p.197, #5-12
  <i><br>#5-12: (a) 3.375 days. (b) SD = 0.9134, so CV = 27.06%. (c) Lead time is important
for both inventory planning as well as customer satisfaction.  Such a large relative variation
in lead time means that predicting inventory levels may be challenging, and customers might
not have a clear idea of when their order may arrive.</i>
  <li> p.210, #5-38,
  <i><br>(a) mean = 16.  (b) P(x&le;11) = BINOMDIST(11,20,0.80,1) = 0.9982%.

  <br>(c) P(x&le;8) = POISSON(8,9,1) = 45.565%.
  <br>(d) From (b), P(x&ge;15) = 4.147%.  If our random check found 15 errors within
  a 1200-word passage, we'd have reason to believe that the computer company's claim is
  overly optimistic: the software's error rate is probably higher than 3 out of 400.<br></i>
