<tr><th><h2>Description</h2></th><td>
    <em>Intermediate programming techniques in one or more programming
      notations.</em>

CMPT166 is a second step for students learning programming by showing them how
object-oriented concepts are employed in the design and writing of code in a
variety of notations.   The emphasis is on the theory of OO programming and
design of solutions, as well as implementation in a current OO language
such as Java or C++.

Students will be introduced to the general
concepts of object oriented programming and will learn one object oriented
language in sufficient detail to be able to produce substantial programs.

<tr><th><h2>Prerequisites</h2></th><td>
CMPT 140 (145 preferred) or an equivalent course or working experience using a
procedural language such as Pascal, Modula-2, Oberon, Python, C, or C++.

<tr><th><h2>Text</h2></th><td>
<b>Required:</b>
<em>Absolute Java</em>, Savitch, 4th edition, Pearson Addison-Wesley, 2009.

<tr><th><h2>Topics</h2></th><td>
We will be using the Eclipse development environment, using
the J2SE 6.0 platform (Java 1.6.0).  This is installed on the computer lab PCs.
You are free to use your own computer, as long as you set your compiler to
produce bytecode compatible with version 1.6 so that your code can be run
on the lab PCs.  No official support will be
provided for installing/compiling on your own computers.

<tr><th><h2>Marking</h2></th><td>
Letter grade assignment follows the TWU percentage to grade equivalents 
except that &gt;=85% and &lt;95% is an A; 95% and above is an A+.

<tr><th><h2>Notes</h2></th><td>
<ol>

<li><b>Every</b> lab must be done; no exceptions!  If you do not turn in 
something for each lab, you will automatically fail the course.
But the late policy is fairly lenient: penalty of 5% per calendar day, up to a
week late.  More than a week late is 50% penalty.  More than two weeks late
and it will not be accepted unless there are extenuating circumstances.
We will use the timestamp on myCourses.
It is your responsibility to make sure all parts of your lab are 
uploaded to the right place in myCourses by the deadline.

<li> If you turn in your lab on-time, you can expect your lab to be marked
within a week.  If you turn in your lab late, you forfeit the privilege of
getting prompt feedback.

<li> <b>Laptops</b> are permitted in-class only for course-related work.
This means <b>no</b> Facebook, YouTube, Halo, etc., (unless directly related
to coursework)!

<li> During in-class quizzes/exams, all of the following are not permitted 
and should be left in your closed/zipped bag and put on the floor:<ul>
  <li> Textbooks, notes, cell phones, laptops, PDAs, iPods,
  <i>electronic dictionaries</i>, calculators.
</ul>
Your desk should be clear except for your pencil/pen.  

<li>In case of inclement weather, call (604) 513-2147 or 
see <a href="http://www.twu.ca/conditions/">www.twu.ca/conditions</a>.
for official campus conditions.
