<li> What is an <b>abstract superclass</b>? What would you use one for?
Give an example of such a situation (no code required, just describe the
situation).  Why does your example need to use an abstract superclass
instead of a regular superclass?  <u>[5]</u>
<br><i>An abstract class is not meant to be instantiated directly.
  An abstract superclass can be used as a way of organizing its subclasses
  under one category.  For example, Dog, Cat, and Cow all are within the
  Mammal category.  It makes sense to have specific instances of Dog, Cat,
  and Cow, but not of Mammal.  Mammal is the abstract superclass.
  In Java, an abstract class is declared with the 'abstract' keyword.
  Concrete subclasses must override all abstract functions and provide 
  bodies to them.

<li> What does the <tt><b>final</b></tt> keyword mean in Java as applied
to (a) attributes, (b) methods, or (c) classes? <u>[4]</u>
<br><i>
  A final attribute is a constant: its value cannot be changed.
  A final method cannot be overriden by subclasses.
  A final class cannot be subclassed.

<li> Name and briefly describe at least three of the five 
<b>Swing layout managers</b> we learned about. <u>[5]</u>
<br><i><dl>
    <dt>FlowLayout:</dt><dd>widgets are placed side-by-side in order of 
    add().</dd>
    <dt>BorderLayout:</dt><dd>widgets can be placed on NORTH, SOUTH,
    EAST, WEST, and CENTER of the container.</dd>
    <dt>GridLayout:</dt><dd>widgets are placed on a regular grid of
    equal-size cells.</dd>
    <dt>GridBagLayout:</dt><dd>like GridLayout, but cells may be non-uniform
    size, and widgets may span multiple cells.  Akin to HTML tables.</dd>
    <dt>GroupLayout:</dt><dd>Specify constraints as ParallelGroups or
    SequentialGroups, independently for each axis.</dd>

<li> Tell me everything you know about <b>serialization</b> in Java. <u>[5]</u>
<br><i>
Serialization is converting an abstract data structure (object) into a series of
bytes suitable for writing into a file or sending over the network.  (In Python
this is "pickling".)  In Java an object is serializable if its class implements
the (empty) interface <tt>Serializable</tt> and if every non-transient attribute
is serializable.  The primitive types (int, char, etc.) and arrays of them are
serializable.  Non-serializable attributes can be skipped over by declaring them
<tt>transient</tt>.  A serializable object can be written out to an
<tt>ObjectOutputStream</tt> by calling its <tt>writeObject()</tt> method.
Similarly, objects (of unknown type) may be read from an <tt>ObjectInputStream</tt>
by calling <tt>readObject()</tt>.

<li class="break"> What is a <b>copy constructor</b> used for?
On a separate page, implement in Java a
<tt>Student</tt> class with attributes <tt>name</tt> (String), <tt>ID</tt>
(int), and <tt>GPA</tt> (float).  Write three constructors: one with no
parameters, one with three parameters (String, int, float), and one that is
a copy constructor. <u>[8]</u>
<br><i>
  A copy constructor performs deep copy: the one parameter is another object
  of the same type, and the copy constructor copies attributes from the other
  object into the current object.
  <pre>
	public class Student {
		String name;
		int ID;
		float GPA;

		public Student( String name, int ID, float GPA ) {
			if (name == null) name = "John Doe";
			if (ID &lt; 0) ID = 0;
			if (GPA &lt; 0.0) GPA = 0.;
			if (GPA &gt; 5.0) GPA = 5.0;
			self.name = name;
			self.ID = ID;
			self.GPA = GPA;
		}

		public Student() { self( null, 0, 0. ); }

		public Student( Student other ) {
			if (other == null) {
				self();
			} else {
				self( other.name, other.ID, other.GPA );
			}
		}
	}
  </pre>
</i>

<li> What is the <b>catch-or-declare</b> rule in Java?  Write a short
function or two in Java that illustrates this rule. <u>[6]</u>
<br><i>
  Catch-or-declare means that if a method runs code that could throw an 
  Exception, that method must either handle the exception itself or
  "pass the buck" by declaring that it could throw that exception:
  e.g., <tt>public void myMethod() throws IOException</tt>.
  If it declares the exception, then any code that calls the method is faced
  with the same catch-or-declare choice.
<pre>
	public Scanner openInput(File filename) throws IOException {
		return new Scanner( filename );
	}
	public static void main( String[] args ) {
		Scanner kbd;
		try {
			kbd = openInput("input.txt");
		} except IOException {
			System.out.println("error reading file");
		}
	}

<li> On a separate page, declare simple Java classes and sketch a UML class diagram 
that formalizes the following set of statements.  Declare and diagram
every (non-primitive) class used.  Implementations of methods are not required.<u>[10]</u>
<ul>
  <li> Every <tt>Shape</tt> has a <tt>lineColour</tt> and <tt>fillColour</tt>.
  <li> Every <tt>Shape</tt> knows how to <tt>draw</tt> itself.
  <li> Everything that knows how to <tt>draw</tt> itself is called a <tt>Drawable</tt>;
  <tt>Shape</tt>s are <tt>Drawable</tt>s.
  <li> There are various kinds of <tt>Shape</tt>s: <tt>Rectangle</tt>s, <tt>Oval</tt>s,
  and <tt>Dot</tt>s.  It doesn't make sense to have an instance of a <tt>Shape</tt>, only
  instances of the subclasses.
  <li> Every <tt>Rectangle</tt> has a <tt>width</tt> and <tt>height</tt>;
  every <tt>Oval</tt> has a <tt>radius</tt> and an <tt>eccentricity</tt> (non-circularity).
  <li> There are also <tt>Square</tt>s, which are <tt>Rectangle</tt>s where the
  height is enforced to be equal to the width, and <tt>Circle</tt>s, which are 
  <tt>Oval</tt>s with <tt>eccentricity=1</tt>.
</ul>
<i><pre>
interface Drawable {
	void draw();
}
abstract class Shape implements Drawable {
	private Colour lineColour;
	private Colour fillColour;
	public void draw() {};
}
class Rectangle extends Shape {
	private float width;
	private float height;
}
class Oval extends Shape {
	private float radius;
	private float eccentricity;
}
class Dot extends Shape {}
class Square extends Rectangle {}
class Circle extends Oval {}
</pre></i>

<li> On a separate page, write a Java function that reads a list of integers
from the file <tt>input.txt</tt> and prints out to the console:
for each unique integer in the file, print the number of times it occurs
in the file (i.e., a <b>frequency table</b>.)
You may assume that the input will only be integers between 0 and 99.
For example, if <tt>input.txt</tt> contained the numbers
<tt>12, 2, 0, 5, 2, 2, 12</tt>, then the output could be:<pre>
N   Count
12  2
2   3
0   1
5   1
</pre>
Format the output so it lines up in neat columns.
The output does not need to be in sorted order.
You do not need to write a complete program that tests this
(and you do not need keyboard-interactive user input), just a
stand-alone function.
Docstrings and comments are not necessary but may be good for partial
credit.  <u>[12]</u>
<br><i>
  See <a href="FreqTable.java">FreqTable.java</a>.
</i>

<li> The Java code below implements a bare-bones Swing application
(just an empty window).  The code works properly.
Modify the code to add a button labelled "Quit"
that closes the application (use <tt>System.exit(0)</tt>) when clicked.
Docstrings and comments are not necessary but may be good for partial
credit.  If you do not remember the exact names of 
classes/interfaces/methods, just make up something close and explain
what you are trying to do.
