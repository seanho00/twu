<li> Consider the UML class diagram below (from
  <a href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/objectOrientation101.html">
    AgileData.org</a>).

    <li> Describe all the relationships involving the Seminar class
    (top right) in the diagram.  Consider multiplicity.
    <br><i>
      Each Seminar has at least one SeminarEnrollment object (which
      references a Student).  There can be any number of students
      on the waitlist.  There can be either 0 or 1 professors instructing
      the Seminar.  The Seminar is an offering of a Course (although
      there can be multiple Seminars for one Course).
    </i><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    <li> What is the role of the SeminarEnrollment class?  Why not
    just have a direct relationship between Student and Seminar?
    <br><i>
      The SeminarEnrollment object holds the info for a registered
      Student in a Seminar: e.g., that Student's marks.
      If the SeminarEnrollment class did not exist, the marks would
      have to be stored either in the Student (disconnected from the
      course) or in the Seminar (disconnected from the Student).
    </i><br><br><br><br>
    <li> What does the looping arrow below and to the right of the
    Professor class mean?  Consider multiplicity.
    <br><i>
      Professors can mentor other Professors: one would be the advisor,
      and the other would be the associate.  Each Professor can be
      the advisor for any number of associates, but each associate may
      have at most one advisor.

  You want to meet up with your two friends, Alice and Bob, for
lunch on Saturday.  You need to make sure they are both free and decide
together on where to go eat.  Draw a UML sequence diagram for this.
Consider synchronous vs. asynchronous messages.
