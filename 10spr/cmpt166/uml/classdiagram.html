			<font size="6">Digging Deeper: Class Diagrams</font></center>
		<p>All class diagrams have classes, links, and multiplicities. But a class diagram can show even more information. We've already looked at generalization, aggregation, and navigability. In this page, we will look at these additional items as well.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>compositions
			<li>class member visibility and scope
			<li>dependencies and constraints
			<li>interfaces
		</ul>
		<p><img height="2" width="800" src="rainbow2.gif" alt="Divider line"></p>
		<p><font size="5">Composition and aggregation</font></p>
		<p>Associations in which an object is part of a whole are aggregations. <a name="Composition"></a><font color="#990000"><b>Composition</b></font> is a strong association in which the part can belong to only one whole -- the part cannot exist without the whole. Composition is denoted by a filled diamond at the whole end.</p>
		<p>This diagram shows that a <b>BoxOffice</b> belongs to exactly one <b>MovieTheater</b>. Destroy the <b>MovieTheater</b> and the <b>BoxOffice</b> goes away! The collection of <b>Movies</b> is not so closely bound to the <b>MovieTheater</b>.</p>

		<p><font size="5">Class information: visibility and scope</font></p>
		<p>The class notation is a 3-piece rectangle with the class name, attributes, and operations. Attributes and operations can be labeled according to access and scope. Here is a new, expanded <b>Order</b> class.</p>
		<p><img height="191" width="445" src="visibility.gif" hspace="10" vspace="15" alt="Visibility and Scope"></p>
		<p>The illustration uses the following UML conventions.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Static members are <u>underlined</u>. Instance members are not.
			<li>The operations follow this form:<br>
			<i>&lt;access specifier&gt; &lt;name&gt; </i>( <i>&lt;parameter list&gt;</i>) : <i>&lt;return type&gt;</i>
			<li>The parameter list shows each parameter type preceded by a colon.
			<li>Access specifiers appear in front of each member.<br>
			<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
				<tr>
					<th bgcolor="#ffffcc">Symbol</th>
					<th bgcolor="#ffffcc">Access</th>

				<tr>
					<td>

		<p><font size="5">Dependencies and constraints</font></p>
		<p>A <a name="dependency"></a><font color="#990000"><b>dependency</b></font> is a relation between two classes in which a change in one may force changes in the other. Dependencies are drawn as dotted lines. In the class diagram below, <b>Co_op</b> depends on <b>Company</b>. If you decide to modify <b>Company</b>, you may have to change <b>Co_op</b> too.</p>
		<p><img height="311" width="616" src="constraint.gif" hspace="10" vspace="15" alt="Constraints and dependencies"></p>
		<p>A <a name="constraint"></a><font color="#990000"><b>constraint</b></font> is a condition that every implementation of the design must satisfy. Constraints can be placed on any kind of model element. They are written in curly braces { }.</p>
		<p>Our diagram has two constraints. The one near the top says that a <b>Section</b> can be part of a <b>CourseSchedule</b> only if it is not canceled. The <font size="4"><tt>{xor}</tt></font> constraint says that a <b>Student</b> must have a <b>CourseSchedule</b> or a <b>Co_op</b> position but not both.</p>
		<p><img height="2" width="800" src="rainbow2.gif" alt="Divider line"></p>
		<p><font size="5">Interfaces</font></p>
		<p>An <font color="#990000"><b>interface</b></font> is a set of operation signatures. In C++, interfaces are implemented as abstract classes with only pure virtual members. in Java, they're implemented directly.</p>
		<p>The class diagram below is a model of a professional conference. The classes of interest to the conference are <b>SessionTalk</b>, which is a single presentation, and <b>Session</b>, which is a one-day collection of related <b>SessionTalk</b>s. The <b>ShuttleSchedule</b> with its list of <b>ShuttleStop</b>s is important to the attendees staying at remote hotels. The diagram has one constraint, that the <b>ShuttleStop</b>s are ordered.</p>
		<p><img height="295" width="384" src="interface.gif" hspace="10" vspace="15" alt="Class diagram with interfaces"></p>
		<p>There are three interfaces in the diagram: <b>IDated</b>, <b>ILocatable</b>, and <b>ITimed</b>. The names of interfaces typically begin with the letter <b>I</b>. A class, such as <b>ShuttleStop</b>, with operations matching those in an interface, such as <b>ILocatable</b>, is a <font color="#990000"><b>realization</b></font> of the interface.</p>
		<p>An interface is a kind of <font color="#990000"><b>stereotype</b></font>. Stereotypes, which provide a way of extending UML, are new kinds of model elements created from existing kinds. A stereotype element contains the stereotype name in guillemets (which look like angle-brace pairs).</p>
		<p>There are two acceptable notations for interfaces in the UML. The first is illustrated above. The second uses the lollipop or pushpin notation.</p>
		<p><img height="214" width="349" src="lollipop.gif" hspace="10" vspace="15" alt="Lollipop interface notation"></p>
		<p>In lollipop notation, the interfaces are circles with lines connected to the realizing classes. Since it is more compact but leaves out some detail, the lollipop notation simplifies the original diagram.</p>
