<li> What do you think of the <b>Java</b> programming language overall?
Compare it to another language you know. <u>[4]</u>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<li> What is <b>object-oriented</b> programming?  How does it differ
from procedural programming? <u>[4]</u>
<br><i>
  Procedural programming is action-oriented: the code is a sequence of
  procedures, and the data structures are passed as parameters to the
  procedures. The focus is on the 'verbs'. In contrast, object-oriented
  programming is data-oriented: code is organized into classes, centred
  around objects, and the procedures are treated as methods within each
  class. The focus is on the 'nouns'.
</i>
<br><br><br><br><br>

<li> Describe and contrast the four options we have in Java for 
<b>access modifiers</b> on attributes/methods. <u>[4]</u>
<br><br><i><dl>
<dt> <tt>private</tt> <dd> only methods in this class can access
<dt> (no modifier) <dd> methods in this class and this package can access
<dt> <tt>protected</tt> <dd> also subclasses can access
<dt> <tt>public</tt> <dd> anyone can access
</dl></i>
<br><br><br>

<li> What is the effect of the <b><tt>static</tt></b> keyword on
attributes and methods?  Why must <tt>main()</tt> be declared static?
Describe another example of an appropriate use of 'static' on an
attribute or method.
<u>[6]</u>
<br><i>
Static members belong to the whole class, rather than to each instance.
Static methods can be invoked from the class without needing to instantiate
the class.  <tt>main()</tt> has to be static because when it is run no
objects have been instantiated yet.
The String library has a number of static utility methods, e.g.,
String.format().  Another example is the constant Math.PI.
</i>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<li> What is the effect of the <b><tt>final</tt></b> keyword on
  <ul class="subparts">
  <li> instance variables? <u>[2]</u>
  <br><i>Constant: cannot change the value of the variable</i>
  <br>

  <li> methods? <u>[2]</u>
  <br><i>Subclasses cannot override (redefine) the method</i>
  <br>

  <li> classes? <u>[2]</u>
  <br><i>Cannot be subclassed</i>
</ul>

<li> Tell me everything you know about <b>polymorphism</b>.
Why is it cool?  <u>[5]</u>
<br><i>
Polymorphism in object-oriented programming is when a single program
or method can act upon multiple types of objects using the same code.
If we write a program to operate on instances of a superclass, then we
can run that program on instances of subclasses of the given superclass
without writing a new version of the program.  We can even create new 
subclasses that hadn't been thought of when the program was written, and
it will run just the same on instances of the new subclass.

<li class="break"> Contrast <b>TCP</b> with <b>UDP</b>.  Describe an application in
which TCP would be more appropriate, and one in which UDP would be more
appropriate. <u>[6]</u>
<br><i>
TCP provides connection-oriented network communication, with certain guarantees
about the circuit.
UDP provides connectionless communication: packets may arrive out of order, or
duplicated, or may not arrive at all.
</i>
<br><br><br><br><br>

<li> What is an <b>interface</b> in Java?  What is an <b>abstract class</b>?
What's the difference?  Describe an example of each (you may come up with your
own).  <u>[6]</u>
<br><i>
  An abstract class is not meant to be instantiated directly. An abstract
  superclass can be used as a way of organizing its subclasses under one
  category. For example, Dog, Cat, and Cow all are within the Mammal category.
  It makes sense to have specific instances of Dog, Cat, and Cow, but not of
  Mammal. Mammal is the abstract superclass.<br>
  An interface is a named set of methods, for instance the ActionListener
  interface specifies the actionPerformed() method and advertises that a class
  knows how to respond to action events.  Interfaces specify functionality,
  i.e., what a class knows how to do.  Abstract superclasses specify identity,
  i.e., what a class is.  Multiple classes that inherit from different
  superclasses may implement the same interface, but in Java multiple
  inheritance is not permitted.
</i>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<li> What is object <b>serialization</b> in Java?  Describe, in as much detail
as you can, a situation where serialization might be useful. <u>[4]</u>
<br><i>
  Serialization converts Java objects into byte streams that can be sent across
  any I/O channel. Objects can be serialized if their classes implement the
  Serializable interface and if all its non-transient instance variables are
  serializable. Primitive types (int, char, etc.) and arrays of primitive types
  are serializable. Any kind of inter-process communication may benefit from
  object serialization: e.g., a client-server restaurant ordering system may
  wish to send objects that represent customer orders over a network I/O
  channel.
</i>
<br><br><br><br><br>

<li> Write a complete Java program that reads in a file "input.txt",
removes all <b>digits</b>, and outputs the result in the file "output.txt".
Include full <b>doc-comments</b> with pre-/post-conditions.  <u>[8]</u>
<br><i>
  (See <a href="StripDigits.java">StripDigits.java</a>.)
</i>

<li> A <b><tt>BankTransaction</tt></b> consists of an account number, date,
dollar amount, and a flag that indicates whether it was a withdrawal or deposit.
Write a complete Java <b>class</b> defining a BankTransaction, including 
attributes, constructors (include a default constructor with no parameters
and a copy constructor), and get/set methods. <u>[10]</u>
<br><i>
  (See <a href="BankTransaction.java">BankTransaction.java</a>.)
</i>

<li> Design a <b>class hierarchy</b> of your own choosing: include an 
abstract superclass and at least two concrete subclasses.  Design attributes and
methods appropriate for each class.  Design a method that takes advantage of the
<b>polymorphism</b> in this class hierarchy, and explain how it does so.  The
polymorphic method does not have to live inside any of the classes. <u>[8]</u>

<li class="break"> What is <b>Android</b>?
Describe how applications are made in Android.  <u>[5]</u>
<br><i>
  Android is a Linux-based operating system made by Google and the Open Handset 
  Alliance, designed for mobile phones, tablets, and low-end computers.
  It is also a component system for building mobile applications.
  Android applications may be composed of multiple Activities, background
  Services, BroadcastReceivers, and ContentProvider databases.
  Each component is implemented by making a subclass of the appropriate type
  (Activity, Service, etc.) and overriding specific methods (hooks), e.g.,
  onCreate(), onResume(), etc.

<li> Name and describe three <b>Creational</b> design patterns. 
Give an example or analogy for each. <u>[6]</u>
<br><i> factory method, abstract factory, prototype, singleton </i>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<li> Name and describe three <b>Structural</b> design patterns.
Give an example or analogy for each. <u>[6]</u>
<br><i> facade, adapter, bridge, proxy, decorator, flyweight</i>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<li> Name and describe three <b>Behavioural</b> design patterns.
Give example or analogy for each. <u>[6]</u>
<br><i>observer, mediator, chain of responsibility, iterator, 
  memento, command </i>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<li> We wish to design software to run a <b>programmable thermostat</b>
(controls heating and cooling).  Draw a UML <b>use-case</b> diagram for the
thermostat. <u>[8]</u>

<li> You want to learn from your friend what he had for breakfast.
The problem is that you are standing on opposite cliffs of a large <b>canyon</b>,
so you have to yell, and you and your friend might <b>hear incorrectly</b> or
<b>not hear</b> what was said.  You also don't know how many items he had for
breakfast.  Draw a UML <b>sequence diagram</b> for a reliable way to learn
what your friend had for breakfast via this unreliable communication channel.
<em>(This is roughly what <b>yodeling</b> was originally used for.)</em>
