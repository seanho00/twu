<ol>

<li> Homeworks are due by the <i>start</i> of class each Wednesday.
<b>NO LATE HOMEWORKS</b> except for extenuating circumstances.
Homework turned in after the start of class up to 5pm on the due date 
(including coming to class late) will be penalized 10%; after that they will
not be accepted and will receive a zero mark.
If you are turning your homework late, it is your responsibility to ensure I
get it.
Late homeworks forfeit the expectation of prompt feedback.
If you cannot come to class to turn in your homework, have a friend hand it in
for you or make prior arrangements with the instructor.

<li> Study groups are encouraged, but the final draft that you hand in must be
your own work.  All work must be shown for full marks.

<li> During in-class quizzes/exams, all of the following are not permitted 
and should be left in your closed/zipped bag and put on the floor:<ul>
  <li>
  <li> Textbooks, notes, cell phones (turn off), laptops, PDAs, 
  <i>electronic dictionaries</i>
</ul>
Your desk should be clear except for your pencil/pen and calculator.

<li> Students who miss more than 25% of class sessions may be barred from taking
the final exam [2009-2010 Academic Calendar p.38].

<li>In case of inclement weather, the TWU campus conditions will be announced
on local radio stations and posted on the TWU website at
<a href="http://www.twu.ca/conditions/">www.twu.ca/conditions</a>.

<li> <b>Academic integrity</b> is a core value of the entire TWU community.
This includes, but is not limited to, avoiding all forms of plagiarism and 
cheating.  Plagiarism is using someone else's work without attribution.
In this course, if you do it once you will get a zero, if you do it again you 
will automatically fail the course.  Any such cases also go into the 
University's files for future reference; TWU has a strict policy concerning
plagiarism.

A tutorial describing plagiarism and how to avoid it has been
prepared by TWU Librarian William Badke:
