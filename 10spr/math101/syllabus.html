<tr><th><h2>Description</h2></th><td>
Basic concepts in mathematics with applications in
business and social sciences. Topics include linear systems,
quadratics, sequences, exponential and logarithmic
functions. Applications include compound interest,
annuities, and linear programming. 

<br>This course is not
intended for students majoring in Science and may not be
used for credit towards a major, concentration, or minor in
Mathematics. It may, however, be required of some Science
majors who are not ready for MATH 105.

<br>Most Business majors take this course prior to MATH 120 unless
their high school credentials are excellent or the results of a pre-test
indicate they may go directly to MATH 120.

<br>This course fulfills a non-lab natural science core requirement.

</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Objective</h2></th><td>
    This course is designed to give students a good understanding of 
    mathematics essential for the study of Business Finance and Social
    Sciences.  It is recommended for all students planning to study
    <b>Business</b>, <b>Finance</b>, or <b>Economics</b>.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Prerequisites</h2></th><td>
A minimum of C in B.C. Principles of Mathematics 11 or equivalent.
<br>
Students with a weak math background or who have not studied math
recently will need to catch up on their own and
perhaps find a private tutor.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Textbook</h2></th><td>
<blockquote>Haeussler, Paul, and Wood,<br>
  <b><em>Introduction to Mathematical Analysis</em></b>,
  12th ed., Prentice Hall.</blockquote>
This text should be available at the campus bookstore.
It is important to use the correct edition, as the homework questions
change from edition to edition.

<tr><th><h2>Marking</h2></th><td>
Letter grade assignment follows the TWU percentage to grade equivalents 
except that &gt;=85% and &lt;95% is an A; 95% and above is an A+.

<tr><th><h2>Notes</h2></th><td>
<ol>

<li> Homeworks are due by the <i>start</i> of class on the due date.<br>
<b>NO LATE HOMEWORKS</b> except for extenuating circumstances.
Homework turned in after the start of class up to 5pm on the due date 
(including coming to class late) will be penalized 10%; after that they will
not be accepted and will receive a zero mark.
If you turn in your homework late, it is your responsibility to ensure I
get it.
Late homeworks forfeit the expectation of prompt feedback -- the TA may take
as long as he/she needs to mark late homeworks.
If you have an illness, family emergency, etc., you must inform the instructor
as soon as possible, before the due date, in order to make special
arrangements.

<li> Study groups are encouraged, but the final draft that you hand in must be
<b>your own work</b>.  All work must be shown for full marks.
Note that only a few questions from each homework may actually be marked.

<li> A scientific <b>calculator</b> is required; graphing or special 
statistical functions are not required.  Please have a separate calculator from
your cell phone or PDA, since these are not allowed during exams.  Sharing of
calculators during exams is not permitted.

<li> During in-class <b>exams</b>, all of the following are not permitted 
and should be left in your closed/zipped bag and put on the floor:<ul>
  <li>
  <li> Textbooks, notes, cell phones (turn off), laptops, PDAs, 
  <i>electronic dictionaries</i>
</ul>
Your desk should be clear except for your pencil/pen and calculator.
Scratch paper will be provided for you.

<li> Mathematics is <b>cumulative</b> in nature; if you miss a class or have a 
gap in understanding of the material, you must fill in that gap first, or else
the subsequent material will make not sense.  Seek help immediately if you
start to feel yourself falling behind!

<li> Students who miss more than 25% of class sessions may be barred from taking
the final exam [2009-2010 Academic Calendar p.38].

<li>In case of inclement <b>weather</b>, the TWU campus conditions will be
announced on local radio stations and posted on the TWU website at 
<a href="http://www.twu.ca/conditions/">www.twu.ca/conditions</a>.

<!--
<li><b>H1N1 flu note:</b> If you begin experiencing H1N1 flu symptoms, you are
advised to self-isolate (stay at home) until 24hrs after your fever has left.
In the unlikely event that circumstances cause a major disruption in the
face-to-face delivery of our course, every effort will be made to ensure the
completion of course learning outcomes.  We may need to rely on electronic
media such as myCourses, this website, and email, so please make sure you check
these regularly.  For more details:

-->

<li> <b>Academic integrity</b> is a core value of the entire TWU community.
This includes, but is not limited to, avoiding all forms of plagiarism and 
cheating.  Plagiarism is using someone else's work without attribution.
In this course, if you do it once you will get a zero, if you do it again you 
will automatically fail the course.  Any such cases also go into the 
University's files for future reference; TWU has a strict policy concerning
plagiarism.

A tutorial describing plagiarism and how to avoid it has been
prepared by TWU Librarian William Badke:
