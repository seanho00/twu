<tr><th><h2>Notes</h2></th><td>
<ol>

<li> Homeworks are due in-class by the <i>start</i> of class each Friday.
<b>NO LATE HOMEWORKS</b> except for extenuating circumstances.
Homework turned in after the start of class up to 5pm on the due date 
(including coming to class late) will be penalized 10%; after that they will
receive a zero mark.
If you can't make it to class, have a friend hand it in
for you or make prior arrangements with the instructor.

<li> If you turn in your lab on-time, you can expect
the TA to have your lab marked within a week.  If you turn in your lab late,
the TA can take as long as he/she needs: you forfeit the privilege of getting
prompt feedback.

<li> Note that only a few questions from each homework might be marked.
Study groups are encouraged, but the final draft that you hand in must be
your own work -- don't just copy another's work!
All work must be shown for full marks.

<li> A scientific calculator is required; graphing or special statistical 
functions are not required.  Please have a separate calculator from your 
cell phone or PDA.

<li> During in-class quizzes/exams, all of the following are not permitted 
and should be left in your closed/zipped bag and put on the floor:<ul>
  <li> Textbooks, notes, cell phones, laptops, PDAs, iPods, dictionaries
</ul>

<li> During in-class quizzes/exams, your desk should be clear except for 
some blank scratch paper, your pencil/pen, and your calculator.  Please
make sure you have your own calculator; sharing of calculators is not 
permitted.

<li> Students who miss more than 25% of class sessions may be barred from taking
the final exam [2006-2007 Academic Calendar p.18].
