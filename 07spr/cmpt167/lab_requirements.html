<h1><a href=".">CMPT167 Spring 2007</a> Lab Requirements</h1>

<h2>Complete all labs</h2>

<p><b>Every</b> lab must be done; no exceptions!  But the late policy is fairly
lenient; <a href="syllabus.html">see the syllabus for details</a>.

<h2>Lab write-up</h2>

<p>Every lab must be accompanied by a lab write-up.
<a href="lab0/Ho_Sean_Lab0_Writeup.html">A template write-up is available</a>; it is a
slightly modified version of the 140/145 lab write-ups.  Have at least
something in every section.

<p> Your write-up file should be named <tt>Last_First_Lab0_Writeup.doc</tt>.
(Replace "Last" with your last name, "First" with your first name, "Lab0" with
the appropriate lab number, and ".doc" with the appropriate file extension.)


<h2>Code doc-comments and style</h2>

<p><a href="lab0/Addition.java">See the sample Java code file for what is
expected in terms of comments, doc-comments (docstrings), and style.</a>

<p>
We will try to follow 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/index.html">
the JavaDoc standard</a> and
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/">
the Sun Java code conventions</a>.
You may also wish to use other javadoc keywords like @see or {@link}.
Each method should also have its own doc comment, including a short
description, preconditions (@param javadoc keyword), and postconditions
(@return keyword).

<h2>Electronic submission</h2>
<p>
Package your source code, write-up, and any other
documentation into a ZIP file or tarball: name it
<tt>Last_First_Lab0.zip</tt> (use your name and lab number, and the appropriate
file extension).
Upload it to the eCourses workspace under the folder for the corresponding lab.

<p>
<a href="lab0/">Here is a sample directory containing all the files you'd need
to package together and upload.</a>

<h2>Marking</h2>

<p>The weighting of marks for each lab will be approximately:<ul>
<li> 30%: Code that does the job
<li> 20%: Code style: doc comments, internal comments, variable/method names,
indentation, etc.
<li> 30%: Lab write-up (excluding test cases)
<li> 20%: Testing
<li> 5-15%: Bonuses (if any)
</ul>
