<ol class="main">

<li> What do you think of the Java programming language overall? <u>[2]</u>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<li> Describe the role of the Java <b>compiler</b> <tt>javac</tt>:
what does it take as input, and what does it output? <u>[3]</u>
<br><i>
The compiler translates Java source code (.java files) to machine-independent
Java bytecode (.class files).  A further runtime translation step by the
Java virtual machine is still needed to produce machine code.
</i>
<br><br><br><br><br>

<li> What are <b><tt>File</tt></b> objects used for in Java? <u>[3]</u>
<br><i>
Reference to a file on disk: pathname, whether it exists or not, whether it's
readable or not, whether it's a regular file vs. directory vs. named pipe, etc.
</i>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<li> Write a complete Java program that outputs the string
"Hello, World!" to the command-line console.
Include full <b>doc-comments</b> as we did in the labs.  <u>[5]</u>
<br><i>
(See <a href="java/HelloWorld.java">HelloWorld.java</a>)
</i>
<br><br>

<li class="break"> Describe and contrast the eight Java <b>primitive types</b>.
<u>[5]</u>
<br><i> <dl>
<dt> <tt>bool</tt> <dd> boolean type, just true and false
<dt> <tt>char</tt> <dd> a Unicode character
<dt> <tt>byte</tt> <dd> an integer represented with 1 byte
<dt> <tt>short</tt> <dd> an integer represented with 2 bytes
<dt> <tt>int</tt> <dd> an integer represented with 4 bytes
<dt> <tt>long</tt> <dd> an integer represented with 8 bytes
<dt> <tt>float</tt> <dd> a real value represented with 4 bytes
<dt> <tt>double</tt> <dd> a real value represented with 8 bytes
</dl></i><br><br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<li> What is the effect of the <b><tt>static</tt></b> keyword on
variables and methods?  Why must <tt>main()</tt> be declared static?
<u>[5]</u>
<br><i>
Static members belong to the whole class, rather than to each instance.
Static methods can be invoked from the class without needing to instantiate
the class.  <tt>main()</tt> has to be static because when it is run no
objects have been instantiated yet.
</i>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<li> Describe and contrast the four options we have in Java for 
<b>access modifiers</b> on attributes/methods. <u>[4]</u>
<br><br><i><dl>
<dt> <tt>private</tt> <dd> only methods in this class can access
<dt> (no modifier) <dd> methods in this class and this package can access
<dt> <tt>protected</tt> <dd> also subclasses can access
<dt> <tt>public</tt> <dd> anyone can access
</dl></i>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<li> Tell me everything you know about <b>polymorphism</b>. <u>[5]</u>
<br><i>
Polymorphism in object-oriented programming is when a single program
or method can act upon multiple types of objects using the same code.
If we write a program to operate on instances of a superclass, then we
can run that program on instances of subclasses of the given superclass
without writing a new version of the program.  We can even create new 
subclasses that hadn't been thought of when the program was written, and
it will run just the same on instances of the new subclass.
</i>
<br><br><br>

<li class="break"> What is <b>downcasting</b>?  Write a simple example in Java.
<u>[5]</u>
<br><i>
A name that is declared to be an instance of a superclass, but that actually
references an instance of a subclass, can be downcast to that subclass type.
An example is when we readObject() from an ObjectInputStream, the object
returned only has type Object.  If we know the real type of the object we read
in, we can downcast it to the appropriate type in order to extract its members.
<pre>
class Fruit { }
class Apple extends Fruit { }
Fruit myFruit = new Apple();
Apple myAppleRef = (Apple) myFruit;	// downcasting is okay
</pre></i>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<li> What is the effect of the <b><tt>final</tt></b> keyword on
  <ul class="subparts">
  <li> instance variables? <u>[2]</u>
  <br><i>Constant: cannot change the value of the variable</i>
  <br><br><br>

  <li> methods? <u>[2]</u>
  <br><i>Subclasses cannot override (redefine) the method</i>
  <br><br><br>

  <li> classes? <u>[2]</u>
  <br><i>Cannot be subclassed</i>
  <br><br><br>
  </ul>

<li> What is an <b>abstract</b> method?  Write complete Java code defining
an abstract class with an abstract method, as well as a concrete subclass.
<u>[5]</u>
<br><i>
Abstract methods do not have bodies; they can only be declared within abstract
classes.  Concrete subclasses provide implementations of the abstract methods.
<pre>
abstract class Fruit {
	public abstract boolean isRed();
}
public class Apple extends Fruit {
	public boolean isRed() { return true; }
}
</pre>
</i>
<br><br><br>

<li class="break"> Compare and contrast the role of a Java
<b><tt>Executor</tt></b> with the role of the <b>task scheduler</b> in
multithreading.
<u>[5]</u>
<br><i>
The Executor for a pool of threads manages which runnable tasks get queued up
for execution.  A Java program may have multiple Executors for multiple pools
of threads.  Executors are software constructs within the Java VM.
The task scheduler is part of the operating system (there is only one), and
manages which tasks get the actual processors at any point in time -- this may
include other tasks on the machine, e.g., reading email, browsing the web,
other users on the same computer, etc.
</i>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<li> Contrast <b>TCP</b> with <b>UDP</b>. <u>[4]</u>
<br><i>
TCP provides connection-oriented network communication, with certain guarantees
about the circuit.
UDP provides connectionless communication: packets may arrive out of order, or
duplicated, or may not arrive at all.
</i>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<li> What is a <b>lock</b> in multithreading?  Why are they important?  How are
they used? <u>[5]</u>
<br><i>
Locks provide mutual exclusion.  If two threads wish to use the same resource
(e.g., write to the same file), they must synchronize their accesses or risk
incorrect results (e.g., corrupting the file).  To use, each thread first
requests the lock before accessing the shared resource.  If another thread has
the lock, the requesting thread is blocked, waiting until the lock is freed.
If no other thread has the lock, the lock is given to the requesting thread,
whereupon it may freely use the shared resource.  After it is done, it yields
the lock so that any other waiting threads may try to get the lock.
</i>
<br><br>

<li class="break"> Define simple Java declarations and sketch a UML 
class diagram that formalizes the following set of statements.
There may be multiple correct interpretations.  <u>[8]</u>
<ul>
<li> Both <tt>Apple</tt>s and <tt>Pear</tt>s are <tt>Fruit</tt>.
<li> Every <tt>Fruit</tt> has a <tt>colour</tt>.
<li> <tt>Fuji</tt> and <tt>Gala</tt> are both kinds of <tt>Apple</tt>s.
<li> All <tt>Apple</tt>s and all <tt>Pear</tt>s (but not all <tt>Fruit</tt>)
are capable of being <tt>Edible</tt>.
<li> Everything that is <tt>Edible</tt> knows how to tell you whether it
<tt>isSweet</tt> or not.
<li> All <tt>Pear</tt>s are sweet (yeah, just assume this!).
<li> I have five <tt>Fuji</tt> <tt>Apple</tt>s.
</ul>
<br><br><i><pre>
public interface Edible {
	public boolean isSweet();
}
public class Fruit {
	String colour;
}
public class Apple extends Fruit implements Edible {
	public boolean isSweet() { return false; }
}
public class Fuji extends Apple {}
public class Gala extends Apple {}
public class Pear extends Fruit implements Edible {
	public boolean isSweet() { return true; }
}
Apple[] myApples = new Apple[5];
</pre></i><br><br>

<hr>
<p>The last two questions are small <b>programming</b> projects: you will need
to write complete Java code (one or more classes) to solve the given problem.
Include a rudimentary test-bed (a separate class or just a main() method).
The API, error-checking, limitations, etc. are all up to
you, but if there are limitations or preconditions on the input, you need to
state that somewhere in your answer.  A full write-up, pseudocode,
comments/doc-comments, are not necessary, but may garner points if your code
isn't perfect. Please use as much paper as you like; there's more
paper at the front of the classroom.  

<li> In Java, implement a <b>sorting</b> algorithm of your choice
that works on arrays of characters (or Strings, if you like).
(No, you may not use one of Java's built-in sorting methods!)
<u>[15]</u>
<br><br>

<li> Write a <b>TCP</b> server and client, and make the client say something
to the server.  You may use any format you wish (strings, binary data,
serialized objects, etc.) for the data to be sent.
