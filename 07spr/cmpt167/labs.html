Lab Assignments</h1>

<h2><a name="1a">Lab 1a: Selection (due Wed 24 Jan) (20pts)</a></h2>
Write a Java applet or Swing program that uses the <tt>if</tt> or
<tt>switch</tt> structures to print the song,
"The Twelve Days of Christmas".  
The user must be asked to enter a day from 1
to 12, and the program must display the corresponding message for that day.
The strings for each day should only appear in your code once each (e.g., the
string "five golden rings" should only appear in your code once).
Google for the lyrics, or make up your own (keep it clean, please).

<h2><a name="1b">Lab 1b: Repetition (due Wed 31 Jan) (20pts)</a></h2>
The <em>proper divisors</em> of an integer n are the positive divisors less
than n.  A positive integer is said to be <em>deficient</em>,
<em>perfect</em>, or <em>abundant</em> if the
sum of its proper divisors is less than, equal to, or greater than the number,
respectively.  For example, 8 is deficient, because its proper divisors are 1,
2 and 4, and 1+2+4 &lt; 8; 6 is perfect, because 1+2+3 = 6; and 12 is abundant,
because 1+2+3+4+6 &gt; 12.  
(The number 1 has no proper divisors and hence is deficient.)
Write an application that classifies n as being
deficient, perfect, or abundant for  n = 20 to 30, then for n = 490 to 500, and
finally for n = 8120 to 8130.

<h2><a name="2">Lab 2: Arrays (due Wed  7 Feb) (40pts)</a></h2>
A magic square is an n x n matrix in which each of the integers 1, 2, 3, ....,
n<sup>2</sup> appears exactly once and all column sums, row sums, and diagonal
sums are equal.  For example, the following is a 5 x 5 magic square in which
all the rows, columns, and diagonals add up to 65:

<p><center><table border="1" cellpadding="10">
<tr><td>17</td><td>24</td><td>1</td><td>8</td><td>15</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>14</td><td>16</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>13</td><td>20</td><td>22</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>12</td><td>19</td><td>21</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>18</td><td>25</td><td>2</td><td>9</td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>
The following is a procedure for constructing an n x n magic square for any odd
integer n.  Place 1 in the middle of the top row.  Then after integer k has
been placed, move up one row and one column to the right to place the next k +
1, unless one of the following occurs: <ol>
<li> If a move takes you above the top row in the jth column, move to
	the bottom of the jth column and place the integer there.
<li> If a move takes you outside to the right of the square in
	the ith row, place the integer in the ith row at the left side.
<li> If a move take you to an already filled square or
	if you move out of the square at the upper-right hand
	corner, place k + 1 immediately below k.
</ol>

<p>
Write a GUI program in JAVA (applet or standalone, AWT or Swing)
to construct an n x n magic square for any odd value of n.

<p>
For this lab, it's okay to do the output as one big long string (e.g.,
JOptionPane.showMessageDialog()), but do make sure that the rows and columns
line up properly -- the non-fixed-width font makes this hard.  It's a better
option (also for future labs) to learn a Swing layout manager and make each
cell a separate widget.

<h2><a name="3">Lab 3: Recursion (due Wed 21 Feb) (40pts)</a></h2>
Write a GUI program in Java to render a fractal 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">L-system</a> using a 
recursive algorithm.  The shape need not be a tree.

<p>
The <a href="java/FractalTree/">FractalTree</a> directory contains a small
Swing application that demonstrates the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/2d/">Java2D graphics API</a>,
including applying transformations and drawing lines.  You may use this code as
a starting point.
The <a href="java/FractalTreeSoln/">solution</a> subdirectory
contains a sample solution program demonstrating a fractal tree.

Your program need not have the cool mouse interaction, but you may add
something similar for up to 10% extra credit.

<h2><a name="4">Lab 4: Object-Oriented Concepts (due Wed 14 Mar) (40pts)</a></h2>

<h3>Part A: Sets</h3>
Create a class <tt>IntegerSet</tt>.  Each object of the class can hold integers
in the range 0 through 99.  Internally, represent the set as an array of
booleans: the <em>i</em>-th element of the array is <tt>true</tt> iff the integer
<em>i</em> is in the set.  The no-parameter constructor initializes the set to
the empty set.  Provide public methods for each of the following:<ul>
<li> A boolean method which returns true if a given integer <b>belongs</b> to the set.
<li> A method which <b>inserts</b> an element into the set.
<li> A method which <b>deletes</b> an element from the set.
<li> A method which tests if the set is <b>equal</b> to another set.
<li> A method which returns the <b>union</b> of two sets.
<li> A method which returns the <b>intersection</b> of two sets.
<li> A method which returns the <b>difference</b> of two sets.
(A - B is all the elements of A which are not in B.)
<li> A method which returns the <b>xor</b> (exclusive or) of two sets.
<li> A <tt>toString()</tt> method which returns a string representation of the
set: e.g., "<tt>{ 0, 15, 87 }</tt>".
</ul>
Write a small testbed class (either command-line or GUI) to show off your
IntegerSet class and its methods.

<h3>Part B: Vectors</h3>
Create a class <tt>Vector</tt>.  Each object of the class has three members
which represent components of the vector along the three coordinate axes.  The
no-parameter constructor initializes the vector to the zero vector (all
components zero).  Provide public methods for each of the following:<ul>
<li> A method which returns the <b>length</b> of the vector as a double.
<li> A method which returns the <b>sum</b> of two vectors.
<li> A method which returns the <b>difference</b> between two vectors.
<li> A method which returns a <b>scalar multiple</b> of the vector (multiplying
each component by the given scalar).
<li> A method which returns the <b>dot product</b> of two vectors.
<li> A method which returns the <b>cross product</b> of two vectors:
(a,b,c) x (x,y,z) = (bz-cy, cx-az, ay-bx)
<li> A <tt>toString()</tt> method which returns a string representation of the
vector in a form like, e.g., "<tt>2.3i - 0.5j + 17.25k</tt>".  If a component
is zero, it should not print the corresponding term.  If the whole vector is
zero, it should just print "<tt>0</tt>".
</ul>
Extend your <tt>Vector</tt> class to a subclass <tt>Vector2D</tt>, which sets
the z-component to zero.  Provide an additional method to draw the vector on
the screen.  Create a testbed program (AWT or Swing, applet or standalone) that
graphically demonstrates Vector2D sum, difference, and scalar multiplication,
using this method.

<h2><a name="5">Lab 5: Files and I/O (due Wed 11 Apr) (60pts)</a></h2>

In this lab you will be implementing an inventory and point-of-sale system for
a fictional store.  Your store may sell whatever items you wish; be creative!

<p>
The objective of this lab is to gain experience in file I/O in Java.
You are free to use any technique you like from ch14 for the databases
(sequential, random-access, text, object-serialized, etc.), but think about
what format would work best for each database.  Discuss the pros and cons
of your file format choice in your lab write-up: how well would it work as the
number of items/records scales up?  Is there a tradeoff of disk space,
searching time (cash register), time to add/delete (inventory control), etc.?
As this lab is fairly complex, it is worth more points.
For the sake of our TA's time, no late labs will be accepted past Fri 13Apr.

<p>
There are two databases (files) that you will need to manipulate:<ul>
<li> An <b>inventory</b> database: for each item, record<ul>
  <li> A <b>description</b> of the item
  <li> <b>Price</b> of the item
  <li> Whether <b>GST</b> applies to the item
  <li> Whether <b>PST</b> applies to the item
  <li> <b>Quantity</b> in stock
  </ul>
<li> A <b>transaction</b> log that is appended to whenever a customer buys
something.  Each transaction record consists of<ul>
  <li> A transaction <b>ID</b> code (if a customer buys multiple items in one
  transaction, there will be multiple records with the same ID code)
  <li> The ID of the <b>item</b> (index into the inventory database)
  <li> <b>Quantity</b> purchased
  </ul>
</ul>

You will need to provide three end-user GUI applications:<ul>
<li> An <b>inventory control</b> program to allow the user to<ul>
  <li> <b>Edit</b> existing items
  <li> <b>Delete</b> existing items
  <li> <b>Add</b> a new item
  <li> <b>Save</b> the inventory database
  </ul>
<li> A <b>checkout register</b> program that a cashier can use to record a
customer's purchases:<ul>
  <li> Select <b>items</b> to be purchased and quantity desired of each item
  <li> Display a <b>receipt</b> showing<ul>
    <li> For each item, its <b>description</b>, <b>price</b> per unit, and <b>quantity</b>,
    <li> The <b>subtotal</b> for this transaction, and 
    <li> The <b>grand total</b> including any GST/PST
    </ul>
  <li> Append to the <b>transaction database</b>
  <li> Update the stock count in the <b>inventory database</b>
  </ul>
<li> A <b>book-keeping</b> program that allows the user to <ul>
  <li> <b>View</b> the transaction database, and
  <li> Generate a <b>report</b> summarizing all the transactions in the
  database: <ul>
    <li> A list of <b>items</b> sold (including <b>quantities</b>)
    <li> Total <b>income</b> (including GST/PST) from all sales
    </ul>
</ul>

You may wish to use some advanced Swing widgets to interact with the databases.
