<ol>

<li><b>Every</b> lab must be done; no exceptions!  If you do not turn in 
something for each lab, you will automatically fail the course.
But the late policy is fairly lenient: penalty of 5% per calendar day, up to a
week late.  More than a week late is
50% penalty.  More than two weeks late and it will not be accepted unless there
are extenuating circumstances.  We will use the timestamp on eCourses.  It is
your responsibility to make sure all parts of your lab are packaged and
uploaded to the right place in eCourses by the deadline.

<li> If you turn in your lab on-time, you can expect
the TA to have your lab marked within a week.  If you turn in your lab late,
the TA can take as long as he/she needs: you forfeit the privilege of getting
prompt feedback.

<li> During in-class quizzes/exams, all of the following are not permitted 
and should be left in your closed/zipped bag and put on the floor:<ul>
  <li> Textbooks, notes, cell phones, laptops, PDAs, iPods,
  <i>electronic dictionaries</i>, calculators.
</ul>

<li> During in-class quizzes/exams, your desk should be clear except for 
some blank scratch paper and your pencil/pen.  

<li>In case of inclement weather, call (604) 513-2147 or 
see <a href="http://www.twu.ca/conditions/">www.twu.ca/conditions</a>.
for official campus conditions.
