<h1><a href=".">CMPT167 Spring 2007</a> Eclipse Intro</h1>

<h2>Starting Eclipse</h2>

<p>Eclipse is installed on the computing lab PCs, under the Programs menu,
Computing.

<h2>Sample project</h2>
<ul>
<li>You may want to create a subdirectory for this course under your Z: "My
Documents".

<li>
<a href="Addition.zip">Download this ZIP file containing a small sample
Eclipse project</a>.   Unpack it in your directory, so that it creates a
subdirectory called "Addition".
</ul>
<h2>Import project</h2>
<ul>
<li> In Eclipse, select File / New / Project
<li> Select "Next" (Java Project)
<li> Under "Project name:", type "Addition"
<li> Under "Contents", select "Create project from existing source", and
browse to the "Addition" subdirectory where you unpacked the ZIP file.
<li> Select the "Finish" button.

</ul>

<h2>Browse the project</h2>
<ul>
<li> If Eclipse's Java Browser is not visible, make it visible by selecting
Window / Open Perspective / Java Browsing.
<li> You should now have a list of projects shown in the top left, and Addition
should be one of the packages (probably the only one).
<li> Click on the project name "Addition"; it should show the packages in that
project (just the default package).
<li> Click on the default package; it should show the "Addition" class in that
package.
<li> Double-click on the "Addition" class, and its source code should show up.
</ul>

<h2>Run the applet</h2>
<ul>
<li> Press the green "Run" button.   A dialog box should pop up to configure
run configurations.
<li> Select "Java Applet" and press the "New" button.
<li> Press the "Run" button and cross your fingers!
<li> If all goes well, an applet window should pop up.  You can play around
with the little addition applet.
</ul>

<h2>Creating a new project</h2>
<ul>
<li>You may wish to create a new project for each lab; use File / New / 
Project.
</ul>

<h2>Installing Java on your own computer</h2>
You may also install Sun's Java SE Development Kit on your own computer.  You
do so at your own risk; no official support will be given for development
environments other than Eclipse on the lab PCs.
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">
Go to Sun's Java developer site</a> (not the cheezy consumer java.com site)
<li> What you want is the JDK (Java Development Kit).
<li> You don't need the EE kit for fancy "Web2.0" applications.  You don't want just the JRE (Java Runtime
Environment) because it doesn't include the javac compiler.
<li> The NetBeans IDE
is a cool free editor / development environment (equivalent to Eclipse); you
can try it but it's not needed to write and compile Java programs.  It is a
huge download.
<li> If you don't have an IDE (Eclipse, NetBeans, etc.), you can always use a
plain-text editor like Notepad, vim, etc.  The compiler is named
<tt>javac</tt>, and the runtime environment to execute a Java class is named
<tt>java</tt>.
<li> The CD included with the Deitel textbook also has the JDK, the NetBeans
IDE, a plain-text editor (jEdit), and other application.
</ul>
