Lab2 (30 pts): Parallel Programming in OpenMP</h1>

<p> In this lab, you will design and implement a parallel program of 
your own choosing, to run on carmel.

<ul>

<li> Choose a task that is computationally intensive, not I/O intensive or
network intensive.  E.g., computing pi via Monte Carlo, not encrypting a large
file.

<li> You should use an OpenMP parallel construct of some sort (duh!), such as
<tt>#pragma omp parallel</tt> or <tt>#pragma omp for</tt>.

<li> Your lab write-up should show a table of 
timing results using 1, 2, 4, and 8 threads,
and different numbers of iterations.
Ideally, we'd see a speedup with more threads, but if your code is right, you
won't lose marks if the speedup isn't dramatic.

<h2>Suggested project ideas</h2>

<li> Some suggestions to help you brainstorm: <ul>

  <li> A numerical integration problem like the pi.c example shown in class
  would be sufficient (choose your own different problem, though).

  <li> Something cooler might be to compute 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set"</a>
  the Mandelbrot fractal</a>.  Some
  <a href="openmp/mandelbrot/">sample serial code</a> is available to help you
  get started (it has an optional X-windows interface; you could try porting it
  to FLTK or some other GUI).

</ul>

<li> Be creative; have fun!

<h2>Lab write-up</h2>

<li> Follow <a href="lab_template.html">the template lab write-up</a>
to document your program.  Name your write-up:
<br><tt>your_name_lab2_writeup.doc</tt> (or .txt, etc.)
<br>Put it in the same project directory as your code so that it will be
included in the tarball.

<h2>Electronic turn-in</h2>

<li> Put everything (C++ code, header files, executable, lab
write-up) into a tarball/ZIP and upload it to eCourses under "Lab2":
<br><tt>your_name_lab2.tar.gz</tt>

</ul>
