<tr><th><h2>Description</h2></th><td>
This course is designed to provide already experienced students with some of
the advanced tools that they need to take their places as competent
professional programmers.  In this offering of CMPT 370, the topics we will be
exploring include graphical user interfaces, parallel programming, and 3D
graphics.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><h2>Objective</h2></th><td>
By the end of the course students should be able to <ul>
<li> <b>understand</b> the concepts of event-driven programming for GUIs and
<b>demonstrate</b> this understanding by programming in FLTK,
<li> <b>understand</b> the concepts of parallel programming and
<b>demonstrate</b> this understanding by programming in OpenMP, and
<li> <b>understand</b> the concepts of 3D computer graphics and
<b>demonstrate</b> this understanding by programming in OpenGL.
</ul>

<tr><th><h2>Notes</h2></th><td>
<ol>

<li> All labs must be completed -- if you do not turn in something for each
lab, you will automatically fail the course.

<li> The good news is
the late policy is fairly lenient: penalty of 5% per calendar day, up to a
week late.  More than a week late is
50% penalty.  More than two weeks late and it will not be accepted unless there
are extenuating circumstances.  We will use the timestamp on eCourses.  It is
your responsibility to make sure all parts of your lab are packaged and
uploaded to the right place in eCourses by the deadline.

<li> During in-class quizzes/exams, all of the following are not permitted 
and should be left in your closed/zipped bag and put on the floor:<ul>
  <li> Textbooks, notes, cell phones (turn off), laptops, PDAs, 
  <i>electronic dictionaries</i>, calculators.
</ul>

<li> During in-class quizzes/exams, your desk should be clear except for 
some blank scratch paper and your pencil/pen.  

<li>In case of inclement weather, call (604) 513-2147 or 
see <a href="http://www.twu.ca/conditions/">www.twu.ca/conditions</a>.
for official campus conditions.
