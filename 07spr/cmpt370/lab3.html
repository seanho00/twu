Lab3 (30 pts): OpenGL Viewer</h1>

In this lab you will develop an interactive OpenGL viewer for 3D models using
FLTK's Fl_Gl_Window.  After completing this lab, you may use this as a base for
subsequent labs.

<ul>
<h2>Basic requirements</h2>

<li> Create a basic 3D viewer application that displays multiple objects.  Use
orthographic (parallel) projection and smooth-shading by default.
You may use <a href="fltk/CubeView/">CubeView</a> as a starting point.

<li> Allow the user to toggle between wireframe, flat-shading, and
smooth-shading.

<li> Allow the window to be resized, but preserve the aspect ratio of the image.

<li> Allow the user to translate, rotate, and (uniformly) scale the model using
the mouse in the Fl_Gl_Window.  See
<a href="http://www.fltk.org/doc-1.1/opengl.html">the FLTK OpenGL docs</a>
and the <tt>handle()</tt> method in Fl_Gl_Window.  
The user should be able to place and orient the model in any way desired.
Also, allow the user to reset the model to its original state.

<li> Display the current rendering speed of your program in polygons per
second.

<li> Use a model with a reasonably large number of polygons, for better
precision in measuring rendering speed.  The model data may be programmatically
generated, hard-coded in your program, or read in from a file.
You can be creative with your model!

<li> Feel free to add on fancier options, user-interface, etc.!

<h2>Questions for your write-up</h2>

<li> How many polygons per second can your render unfilled and filled?

<li> What is the effect on performance of using quadstrips or triangle strips
versus quads or triangles?

<li> What is the effect on performance of putting multiple primitives between a
glBegin/glEnd versus using a separate glBegin/glEnd for each one?

<h2>Lab write-up</h2>

<li> Somewhere in your write-up, answer each of the questions in the preceding
section.

<li> Follow <a href="lab_template.html">the template lab write-up</a>
to document your program.  Name your write-up:
<br><tt>your_name_lab3_writeup.doc</tt> (or .txt, etc.)
<br>Put it in the same project directory as your code so that it will be
included in the tarball.

<h2>Electronic turn-in</h2>

<li> Put everything (C++ code, header files, executable, lab
write-up) into a tarball/ZIP and upload it to eCourses under "Lab3":
<br><tt>your_name_lab3.tar.gz</tt>

<li> For this lab only, the late penalty will be reduced to one point per
calendar day, up to two weeks.  Lab3 cannot be submitted more than two weeks late.

</ul>
